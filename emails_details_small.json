When a project is extremely uncertain, it\u2019s helpful to try and \u201cdo it all\u201d in one or two weeks (which you\u2019ll fail to accomplish) but it helps you quickly suss out how big the project would be.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\u2615\ufe0f Snackables\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nDigestible, quick-hitting\u00a0 blogs packed with ideas & tips to improve your work day.\u00a0\r\n\r\n5 Habits to Build a Productive Routine & Feel Fulfilled Each Day ( https://www.sunsama.com/blog/build-a-productive-routine )\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBeing productive doesn't mean chaining yourself to a desk and measuring success by how busy you look.

Specifically, ones you've put off dealing with/forgotten/buried in your inbox, and now have to deal with as part of your work?\r\n\u00a0\r\n\ud83c\udf99 Ashutosh's response:\r\n\r\nI feel you. I used to delay and procrastinate on emails for days I didn\u2019t want to deal with because thinking about them stressed me out. I think an inbox-zero strategy helps deal with this. It\u2019s just my policy to respond to every email that comes in a day whether I enjoy the email or not. To this day, I think of email as school homework. It\u2019s just something you need to do, that you won\u2019t enjoy, and it\u2019s getting in the way of the fun stuff.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing is, even doing inbox-zero, I actually still see the same procrastination behavior but it\u2019s isolated to one day and one inbox session. The emails I really don\u2019t want to respond to are the ones I\u2019ll read, skip over, and then swap to another email that\u2019s easier to deal with. I keep repeating this cycle until the email in question is the only one left in my inbox. It\u2019s not efficient to skim that same email seven times as I avoid it each time but it\u2019s better than letting it linger for days.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\ud83c\udfc6 Sunsama Squad Wins\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nHave something to share about Sunsama?

What we typically hear from folks who try fully automated daily planners (and then use Sunsama) is that they go into it \u201cwanting a fully automated solution\u201d because it sounds like less work but end up feeling \u201coverwhelmed\u201d and \u201cnot in control\u201d of when they\u2019re working, feeling like the algorithm is pushing them to work at all sorts of times they\u2019d never actually work.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve opted for the solution that provides more calm and control even if it requires more effort.

Apparently, the lack of color is less interesting to the brain, and so you end up using your phone less. In my first week, I saw a ~20% reduction in screen time. But a few weeks in, I\u2019m finding my phone is not consistently staying in grayscale and my screen time is ticking back up. Inevitably, someone sends me a picture I want to view in color, I toggle grayscale off (by tapping the side button three times) but then forget to turn grayscale back on.\r\n\r\nI know a lot of you toggled on grayscale mode after my email about this and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve had the same experience? I really wanted to believe in this one but it feels too easy to habituate to and forget to use.\r\n\r\nSo this week, I\u2019m trying an automation that sets my phone to grayscale automatically, inspired by the instructions in this great tweet by Andrew Chen ( https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1761156911276409121 ). I\u2019ll let you know how it goes but wanted to share it with everyone trying along who is in the same boat.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\u2615\ufe0f Snackables\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nDigestible, quick-hitting\u00a0 blogs packed with ideas & tips to improve your work day.\u00a0\r\n\r\nBeyond Dopamine Detox: A Guide to Building Productive Habits ( https://www.sunsama.com/blog/beyond-dopamine-detox-a-guide-to-building-productive-habits )\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe keep hopping from one app to another, craving the next notification, the next like, the next episode.

My course is busy and intense (7 classes at any given time) and the environment/program does not encourage job searching at the same time. I am curious about how I could make actively looking for a job part of my routine in my final semester.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\ud83c\udf99 Ashutosh's response:\r\n\r\nSeven classes is a lot. If I were in your position, I\u2019d feel like I barely have enough time to think about working on the job search letting alone executing on it. So my first step would be to do just enough that I start building mental momentum towards it.\r\n\r\nFor example, set aside 5 minutes a day as you are going through your inboxes to also search for jobs you want to apply for. Some days you might not find anything in that amount of time but if you do that for a couple weeks, you might end up with a short list of jobs you are really excited for. Then you\u2019ve got momentum and it\u2019s going to feel natural to carve out a big chunk of time on a weekend where you sit down and apply to it.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\ud83c\udfc6 Sunsama Squad Wins\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nHave something to share about Sunsama?

Arbaugh described the sensation by saying it felt like \u201cusing the force on a cursor.\u201d\r\nBrain-computer chips have been around for over 20 years, but Nueralink\u2019s display was novel for two main reasons. First, Nueralink\u2019s device transmits data wirelessly, meaning its mobile and not clunked down by wires. Second, Neuralink\u2019s chip allows for a certain level of multi-tasking (playing chess telekinetically while speaking about surgery for example) that is indistinguishable from how a \u201cnormal\u201d brain works.\r\nSay what you want about Musk, but the guy delivers. For those taking notes at home, over the past two weeks, he:\r\nLaunched the largest flying object ever into orbit with SpaceX,\r\nIntroduced the most sophisticated brain-computer interface ever with Neuralink,\r\nReleased Full Self Driving v12.3 in Tesla cars,\r\nOpen sourced xAI\u2019s foundation model, Grok,\r\nContinued to shitpost on his public square toy, X. \r\nElon tweeted that Blindsight is next for Neuralink [ https://substack.com/redirect/d28fda16-87df-4744-b206-8c7a6be8a5b5?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] after Telepathy, and that it\u2019s already working in monkeys [ https://substack.com/redirect/ced6fda8-6842-4ada-aecf-46ebf2120b73?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ].\r\nThere will always be Elon haters, but at some point, you\u2019ve just got to acknowledge how incredible this string of accomplishments is. \r\nWhat did you get done this week? \r\n(2) World\u2019s First Genetically-Edited Pig Kidney Transplant into Living Recipient Performed at Massachusetts General Hospital [ https://substack.com/redirect/40db3fc2-b258-43ec-8c66-f187ca2f393c?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]\r\nBrandon Chase for Massachusetts General Hospital \r\nThe pig kidney was provided by eGenesis of Cambridge, Mass., from a pig donor that was genetically-edited using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to remove harmful pig genes and add certain human genes to improve its compatibility with humans.\r\nBig week for the pigs. \r\nLast night, I had pork sausage for dinner. It was delicious. It was spicy. It was made from pigs\u2026probably many different parts of a pig. I purchased it at Whole Foods. \r\nOn Wedensday, Nature [ https://substack.com/redirect/8c0212a2-6bdf-4a90-99dc-0a7807bf90ad?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] reported [ https://substack.com/redirect/8c0212a2-6bdf-4a90-99dc-0a7807bf90ad?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] that a pig liver transplanted into a clinically dead man in China lasted for ten days. \u201cWith consent from the man\u2019s family, researchers stitched the organ, from a genetically engineered miniature pig, to the man\u2019s blood vessels, where it remained for ten days.\u201d\r\nXenotransplantation \u2014 transplanting organs, tissues, or cells from one species to another \u2014 is important because there\u2019s a dramatic shortage of human organs needed for transplant across the world. In China alone, hundreds of thousands of people suffer liver failure each year but only 6,000 received a liver transplant in 2022. More than 100,000 people in the U.S. await an organ for transplant and 17 people die each day waiting for an organ. \r\nWell fans of xenotransplantation must be like pigs in mud right now, because yesterday, the porkies did it again! \r\nMass General announced that it successfully performed the first transplant of a genetically-edited pig kidney into a living patient. It\u2019s the most recent in a string of wins for CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. \r\nAs you might imagine, transplanting an organ from one species to another presents complications, from immune rejection to cross-species virus transmission. In 2022, doctors at the University of Maryland performed the first successful xenotransplantation of a pig heart into a human patient, who remained alive for two months before passing. \r\neGenesis [ https://substack.com/redirect/0ee1b7e4-d2f9-4879-b830-4942fac53d85?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], the company behind the kidney, is betting that it can overcome those challenges by editing the genes in the organs to remove harmful pig genes and add human genes in order to improve compatibility. \r\nWe\u2019ll have to wait to see if this transplant sticks, but just the fact that humans are editing pig genes to potentially save human lives is pretty porking magical. Can we get an oink oink?!\r\n(3) Intel Receives $8.5 Billion in Grants to Build Chip Plants [ https://substack.com/redirect/cfd5bd11-c9a2-40c0-b952-fe27292b4449?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]\r\nZolan Kanno-Youngs [ https://substack.com/redirect/3f0a1b6a-fd2e-473e-a3af-ed7857808a8c?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ],\u00a0Madeleine Ngo [ https://substack.com/redirect/f4a89e7f-0e82-4616-8149-d69a174a4f07?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] and Don Clark [ https://substack.com/redirect/584ce7dc-e768-464b-bcc5-726dc927acc5?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] for The New York Times\r\nPresident Biden on Wednesday awarded $8.5 billion in grants to Intel, a major investment to bolster the nation\u2019s semiconductor production, during a tour of battleground states meant to sell his economic agenda.\r\nThe Biden Administration awarded an $8.5 billion grant to Intel as part of the CHIPS Act to boost domestic semiconductor production. At the press conference, President Biden asked: \r\n\u201cWhere the hell is it written saying that we\u2019re not going to be the manufacturing capital of the world again?\u201d\r\nWhere the hell is it written, indeed, Mr. President. \r\nWhether federal dollars can bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US of A and reverse overreliance on Taiwan is another question. \r\nIt\u2019s not that the intention is wrong \u2014 bolstering U.S. chip manufacturing is probably one of the highest ROI things the federal government can do \u2014 it\u2019s that awarding $8.5 billion to a company that has been relatively stagnant for a few decades may not be the most effective way to achieve that ROI. \r\nAnd there are bigger structural issues: it\u2019s slower and more expensive to get fabs built here, we have a shortage of trained labor, and as Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner pointed out on BG2 [ https://substack.com/redirect/907e9e7e-77f3-472e-aee4-cb32ae98771b?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], our workforce may be too comfortable to stick with a company long enough and put in the long hours required to build technical expertise.  \r\nThat said, Biden has $39 billion to play with thanks the the CHIPS Act and we\u2019re happy to see those dollars getting put to work. Now, does it just so happen that at least $8.5 billion of those dollars are being injected into the state of Arizona, creating new, high-paying jobs the same year that a Presidential election is occurring in which Arizona is a key battleground state. Yes, that does seem to be the case.\r\nEither way, it\u2019s an acknowledgment that technology is important, that the US needs to get back to building, and a step towards training the workforce to build chips. Who controls the chips controls the universe. \r\n(4) This Startup Is One Step Closer To Making Drugs In Space [ https://substack.com/redirect/5ed5f308-77f4-4936-a3fd-daa9a9797612?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]\r\nAlex Knapp for Forbes\r\nWith its first demonstration mission a success, Asparouhov said the company is ready to start making products for customers on its orbital manufacturing platform. These wouldn\u2019t necessarily be small batches, either.\r\nPacky here. I\u2019m a simple man. Varda announces something that takes us one step closer to making space drugs, and opening up the space economy, I share it. \r\nIn June 2023, before Varda\u2019s first launch, I wrote about what they were hoping to prove:\r\nThis first flight is mainly a test. Varda needs to prove, primarily, that it can send a factory to space, orbit it around the earth, and send a capsule with a payload safely back down to the planet\u2019s surface.\u00a0\r\nIf things go really well, Varda will also showcase its ability to manufacture drugs in space. It will crystallize ritonavir in microgravity in order to explore how gravity influences the resulting crystal structure.\r\nA couple of weeks ago, they achieved the primary objective when its W-1 capsule landed safely in the Utah desert. \r\nThis week, Varda announced that things had indeed gone really well. They successfully crystallized ritonavir in microgravity. \r\n\u201cThat Varda\u2019s ritonavir was created exactly as predicted, and remained stable through its return to Earth, is particularly promising,\u201d Knapp wrote in Forbes. \u201cThe version of the drug the company attempted is one of its least stable forms.\u201d\r\nWith the successful test run under its belt, Varda is now a go to begin making drugs for pharma customers in space. Maybe even more importantly, as Delian explained, it paves the path to Varda being \u201cthe first company to actually show that there\u2019s value to atoms being moved back and forth from space.\u201d\r\nWhen the space supply chain is booming one day, you can tell your grandkids (over tightbeam) that you were there at its birth.\r\nP.S. I almost wrote this in Tuesday\u2019s piece on Techno-Optimistic Media [ https://substack.com/redirect/a1bb6832-2f30-4374-a776-c9788c39a300?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], but Varda has been an exception to the rule that startups aren\u2019t a great fit for journalists. They\u2019ve gotten great coverage from the WSJ, CNN, CNBC, The New York Times, and more. I thought Knapp\u2019s piece in Forbes was great. Do compelling things and bring proof, and there are plenty of techno-optimistic journalists willing and ready to cover them.  \r\n(5) The IRS Finally Has an Answer to TurboTax [ https://substack.com/redirect/fe610e1f-9848-46c0-94d2-17bd89558376?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]\r\nSaahil Desai for The Atlantic\r\nDirect File isn\u2019t perfect\u2014the program is available in only 12 states [ https://substack.com/redirect/c819aeba-a34a-446a-b17b-bc2578484e89?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], and it isn\u2019t able to handle anything beyond the simplest tax situations\u2014but it\u2019s a glimpse of a world where government tech benefits millions of Americans. In turn, it is also an agonizing realization of how far we are from that reality.\r\nFun little reminder here: Tax Day is 24 days away. \r\nTax Day is important because its the day during which the government compels its citizens to pay (always surprisingly high) taxes in order to fund things like the aforementioned $8.5 billion Intel/Arizona grant. For years, it\u2019s been even more fun thanks to services like TurboTax. TurboTax is a product from Intuit, a private corporation that offers a variety of individual and SMB financial products and for years has been lobbying Washington to keep the process of filing taxes asininely complex. Why would Intuit do such a thing?\r\nBecause if it\u2019s hard and scary to file taxes, then the 150M+ Americans that need to file taxes each year will turn to TurboTax to help them do it. Let\u2019s say the average TurboTax customer pays $100 per year. That $15 billion of sweet, high margin government-forced ARR up for grabs. And if it\u2019s even harder and scarier, then customers will be convinced into purchasing upsell products and consultations. \r\nThe other fun part comes a few weeks later, when the IRS tells you that you actually messed up and didn\u2019t pay the right amount, which it turns out they knew all along, but Intuit\u2019s lobbyists asked them to make you try to guess anyway just for funsies. \r\nThe thing is\u2026filing taxes shouldn\u2019t be that hard and complex. If the IRS knows, you should be able to work directly with the IRS, online, if you so choose. \r\nEnter Direct File. Direct File is a new pilot tax filing service introduced by the IRS to allow eligible taxpayers to file their taxes online for free, directly with the IRS. It\u2019s designed for simplicity, is offered in English and Spanish, and supported by mobile-first real-time online support from IRS customer service representatives\u2026who don\u2019t have the incentive to upsell you on a bunch of products. It\u2019s now available in 12 states [ https://substack.com/redirect/0e0203c5-db68-483c-bd78-ca20874034b7?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ].\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I am all for private businesses offering services that complement government services \u2014 that\u2019s in part what makes the American economy so dynamic \u2014 but not when incentives are totally out of whack.

I was confused by the gap between the positive progress I saw happening around me, and the general negative sentiment that had taken hold despite that. Part of the problem, I thought, was that very few people were hearing about the amazing things happening. \r\nSince then, there\u2019s been a major vibe shift, at least in our corner of the internet. Startups are building mind-blowing things, often physical things, and those stories are getting out. \r\nSo when Christian Keil [ https://substack.com/redirect/3fe4a342-81bc-4a1c-9bd6-46ba7e6cb371?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] suggested that we co-write a piece on the rise of Techno-Optimistic Media and what it means for startups, I jumped at it. \r\nChristian [ https://substack.com/redirect/3fe4a342-81bc-4a1c-9bd6-46ba7e6cb371?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] is emblematic of the kind of person telling tech\u2019s stories today. By day, he\u2019s the Chief of Staff at Astranis [ https://substack.com/redirect/e7e39486-672f-45ee-b010-be4a4eed4ec2?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], which makes communications satellites, and by night, he hosts First Principles [ https://substack.com/redirect/7d0bd222-5cc1-4629-aff1-0bc2e9107c6c?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], an interview series that dives deep into the technical side of deep-tech startups. Christian is also a venture partner for Not Boring Capital, where he focuses on aerospace, defense, and energy investments.\r\nWe\u2019re just two of the many people who are part of the amorphous thing we\u2019re calling Techno-Optimistic Media. We don\u2019t speak for the whole group, which comes in many flavors. But we\u2019ve gotten to see the value founders get from telling their story more directly firsthand and wanted to share what we\u2019ve learned. \r\nLet\u2019s get to it. \r\nTechno-Optimistic Media\r\nCan you feel the acceleration?\u00a0\r\nLast Monday, Extropic released its whitepaper, Ushering in the Thermodynamic Future [ https://substack.com/redirect/567e120e-cf06-4f64-b8f0-43dadd628730?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]. On Tuesday, Cognition AI released its AI Software Engineer, Devin [ https://substack.com/redirect/63e75ed0-8ea9-4ccf-87b5-a26348d2e4f2?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ].

On Thursday, SpaceX successfully launched its Starship [ https://substack.com/redirect/dc877196-6357-4989-adf7-b2ef8a1ef4ff?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] rocket into orbit.\r\nLast week was a historically uncommon week of the sort that is becoming increasingly common.\u00a0\r\nTechnology is accelerating, and we\u2019re witnessing it in real-time, thanks to the emergence of new channels for founders to share what they\u2019re building, unfiltered. The stories above weren't published through mass media channels. Instead, they were broadcast directly from the source, straight to the people most eager to hear about them \u2013 and they were amplified by Techno-Optimistic Media.\u00a0\r\nExtropic went deep answering Christian\u2019s technical questions on First Principles [ https://substack.com/redirect/63fb9bf1-c432-4dac-a52e-9c2c94955087?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], sat down for a conversation with Garry Tan [ https://substack.com/redirect/6070b0f1-7343-40bb-aead-12529ca1f109?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], and handed the twitter mic to Andrew C\u00f4t\u00e9 [ https://substack.com/redirect/83ac8975-597a-4372-bd3f-4bd304b3814d?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] to put the technology in context.\u00a0\r\nCognition partnered with startup comms savant Lulu Cheng Meservey [ https://substack.com/redirect/fe4ef8d3-1141-4e39-9c41-1af67012e171?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] on Devin\u2019s launch, which included an Ashlee Vance writeup [ https://substack.com/redirect/359f2e83-eeea-4d82-b8f9-f09572e65006?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] and a tweet [ https://substack.com/redirect/63e75ed0-8ea9-4ccf-87b5-a26348d2e4f2?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] that broke the internet to the tune of 24.2 million views.\u00a0\r\nFigure let its robot do the talking.\u00a0\r\nAnd SpaceX live streamed its launch [ https://substack.com/redirect/572812fd-a8d5-4672-a409-8520ac0307f9?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] on the social media platform its founder owns. There are levels to this.\r\nThe Techno-Optimistic Media is a loose collection of newsletters, podcasts, YouTube channels, X accounts, and founders themselves that are less journalist and more storyteller. It\u2019s a decentralized, internet-native response to gap left by the way the traditional press talks about tech.\u00a0And it spreads stories at the speed of memes. \r\nHard-hitting journalism is critically important, but there\u2019s often a mismatch between the work that journalists do gathering, verifying, and contextualizing facts and the simple truth that most startups operate more as dream than reality.\u00a0\r\nThe Techno-Optimistic Media fills the gap for startups that want to communicate their stories to a wider audience while they\u2019re still more outline than output. It treats early ideas seriously, analyzes ambitions, and has built relatively small, but extremely targeted, \u201clocal\u201d communities of investors, builders, and techno-optimists who are unabashed fans of tech startups.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nWe\u2019re both a part of the Techno-Optimistic Media \u2013 Packy with Not Boring and Age of Miracles and Christian with First Principles \u2013 but only a small part: it\u2019s a constellation of niche publications that amplify each other instead of one organization with New York Times scale ambition.\u00a0\r\nIf we eventually reach a larger audience and make the world more optimistic [ https://substack.com/redirect/950dc6d5-5aae-4403-adda-f1904192a933?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], as is our not-so-secret plan, it won\u2019t be by trying to build The Times, But Tech, but instead by growing concentrically outward alongside the companies we highlight. As their dreams turn into realities and actually improve peoples\u2019 lives, the audience for positive stories about technology companies will grow, too.\u00a0\r\nIn the meantime, Techno-Optimistic Media serves an underserved niche with a new product designed explicitly to help founders reach potential employees, investors, customers, and fans in order to nudge their odds of success from low to slightly-higher.\u00a0\r\nWe would both love to live in a world in which we could open up the newspaper every morning to positive stories of technology companies doing incredible things. To get there, media organizations need to see the market potential of optimistic takes, and entrepreneurs need to avoid the pitfalls of ignoring \u201cmedia-message fit.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\r\nSo this piece will cover both:\u00a0\r\nWhy now is the right time for Techno-Optimistic Media.\u00a0\r\nHow founders can think about their media strategy as they grow.\r\nLet\u2019s start with one of the most jarring aspects of Techno-Optimistic Media: it\u2019s explicitly, unabashedly biased. Sounds bad. But every other modern media organization is biased, too, whether they admit it or not.\r\nNiches, Big and Small\r\nThe platonic ideal of reporting \u2013 most closely approximated by newspapers and TV channels in the Dan Rather era \u2013 saw these mass media companies idealistically delivering fair and unbiased reporting.\u00a0\r\nThe people who ran those media organizations were no more noble than the people who run news organizations today. Their incentive was to reach as many people as possible, whatever those people\u2019s beliefs, and the best way to do that was to deliver the facts. They were truly mass media.\r\nBut, unfortunately, Americans today trust such mass media less than they ever have.\u00a0\r\nWhen people look at that chart, they overemphasize the media, believing that news writers are failing to live up to their old promise of journalistic integrity. The real challenge is mass.\u00a0\r\nThe confusing thing is that while many of the same organizations \u2013 from The New York Times to NBC \u2013 are still in business, their incentives have changed, and their products have changed alongside their incentives. They\u2019ve gone from serving the masses, to serving a very large niche.\u00a0\r\nIt\u2019s disconcerting for someone in tech to open up The New York Times and read technology coverage that doesn\u2019t reflect the facts that they see on the ground. The fact is, it\u2019s not The New York Times\u2019 job to get people to love technology. Their job is to serve their niche.\u00a0\r\nAs Ben Thompson wrote in the excellent Never-Ending Niches [ https://substack.com/redirect/9c00fd1f-620b-4942-94f6-8a48c541856d?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], \u201cWhile quality is relatively binary, the number of ways to be focused \u2014 that is, the number of niches in the world \u2014 are effectively infinite; success, in other words, is about delivering superior quality in your niche \u2014 the former is defined by the latter.\u201d\u00a0\r\nThe Times\u2019s niche, he says, includes the \u201cEverything tech does is bad\u201d niche. In that context, even anti-tech stories that are \u201cdeeply flawed at best, and willfully mendacious at worst\u201d are \u201cvery high quality for much of The New York Times\u2019s audience.\u201d\u00a0\r\nThis might be a bit controversial to say in tech circles, but that\u2019s totally fine! The New York Times is a business, and their readers expect something specific from them: dispassionate, measured, \u201crealistic\u201d analysis. And, realistically, most founders won\u2019t change the world like they all claim they will.\r\nSaid differently, the idealistic goal of a publication like The New York Times is to verify and contextualize facts about the world. And the truth is that in a startup\u2019s earliest days, the facts are sparse and the dream is still, well, a dream.\u00a0\r\nMass media journalism and early-stage startups simply don\u2019t have \u201cmedia-message fit.\u201d There\u2019s not enough there there to do real journalism on. So either journalists treat startups with the same tenacity as they\u2019d treat a more mature company and find them lacking, or the startup contorts itself into something they think a journalist wants to hear. It\u2019s a mismatch.\u00a0\r\nBut that\u2019s also an opportunity. You don\u2019t win by getting mad, but by competing.\u00a0\r\nIf you view media organizations as businesses with customers, and believe that the largest underserve important and growing groups of customers, then the setup is ripe for disruption.\u00a0\r\nDisrupting Media\r\nThe term disruption is used far too often to mean anything new that competes with anything old, but there\u2019s a specific definition that the late Harvard professor Clayton Chrisensen used. In What is Disruptive Innovation? [ https://substack.com/redirect/b9db4051-fa8c-4a68-983e-e04adb6170bf?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], he wrote (emphasis ours):\u00a0\r\nFirst, a quick recap of the idea: \u201cDisruption\u201d describes a process whereby a smaller company with fewer resources is able to successfully challenge established incumbent businesses. Specifically, as incumbents focus on improving their products and services for their most demanding (and usually most profitable) customers, they exceed the needs of some segments and ignore the needs of others. Entrants that prove disruptive begin by successfully targeting those overlooked segments, gaining a foothold by delivering more-suitable functionality\u2014frequently at a lower price. Incumbents, chasing higher profitability in more-demanding segments, tend not to respond vigorously. Entrants then move upmarket, delivering the performance that incumbents\u2019 mainstream customers require, while preserving the advantages that drove their early success. When mainstream customers start adopting the entrants\u2019 offerings in volume, disruption has occurred.\u00a0\r\nTechno-Optimistic Media serves two overlooked segments: pro-tech audiences and founders.\u00a0\r\nPro-tech audiences might include people in tech, people who want to work in tech, investors, generally curious people who want to understand where the world is heading, and people who are sick of reading bad news every time they open the paper. These customers are overlooked by mass media organizations who are appealing to the broadest common denominator \u2013 who, unfortunately, don\u2019t (yet) love tech.\r\nTechno-Optimistic Media might not do the level of journalism that legacy media does, and they certainly don\u2019t employ armies of editors and fact-checkers. The product is not as polished. But in exchange, the Techno-Optimistic product is free and, well, optimistic, which means that it is both accessible and appealing to pro-tech audiences.\u00a0\r\nFounders, or more generally subjects of articles, aren\u2019t typically thought of as customers of media organizations, but they are, even if they don\u2019t pay. When a CEO or politician sits down with a journalist and hands over their message to a third-party, they\u2019re paying with information that would otherwise stay private in exchange for reach and credibility.\u00a0\r\nTechno-Optimistic Media doesn\u2019t offer founders the reach or general population credibility that an organization like The New York Times does, but it does offer founders a way to reach a smaller, more targeted audience with a more direct \u2013 and more predictably favorable \u2013 version of their story. In exchange, Techno-Optimistic Media gets access to stories and insights their pro-tech audiences demand\u2026 and have a lot of fun producing content about the industries and technologies that they think have the greatest chances of changing the world for the better.\u00a0\r\nIf Techno-Optimistic Media displaces any part of legacy media over time, it won\u2019t be by trying to build the same product in a techno-optimistic flavor. It will be by starting at the low-end, and growing alongside the founders they partner with.\u00a0\r\nThe Techno-Optimistic Media is explicitly biased and incentive-aligned because we want tech companies to succeed. We want cheaper energy and abundant goods and robot assistants and financial freedom and human flourishing, and our reach will grow as technologists deliver on those promises. And we have skin in the game, whether as technologists or investors.\r\nOur bias is that technological progress is good, actually.\u00a0\r\nCreating small spaces for people who share that bias is a surprisingly big shift.\u00a0\r\nAside: Small Spaces and Scenius\r\nAs we transition from \u201cWhy Techno-Optimistic Media?\u201d to \u201cHow founders should think about their media strategies,\u201d a quick aside on the importance of small spaces and scenes.\u00a0\r\nDespite everything we\u2019ve written, we understand the temptation to go big. But there\u2019s real value in starting small. It\u2019s true in the real world, and we think it\u2019s true online.\u00a0\r\nIn Small Spaces [ https://substack.com/redirect/abc3dbae-aa1e-49ff-a3ec-f7793a5ec691?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], Simon Sarris argues that \u201cculture is not created in cities so much as assembled and discovered there. It is created in smaller spaces.\u201d\r\n\u201cGiven the typical assumptions about the multiplicative effects of human capital,\u201d he asks, why has one of these places created four trillion-dollar companies and the other zero?\u00a0\r\nThere are a number of well-studied hypotheses for Palo Alto\u2019s success, but Sarris thinks that its smallness is underappreciated.\u00a0\r\nWhy? Sarris has thoughts \u2013 rent prices, remoteness, authenticity, and the \u201cferment that we have relied on in the less-connected world.\u201d Another answer might be purely statistical \u2013 aggregate enough people together, and you\u2019re more likely to end up with an average group.\r\nBut we like Kevin Kelly\u2019s answer best.\u00a0\r\nIn Scenius, or Communal Genius [ https://substack.com/redirect/50412ee7-72ed-47df-aab2-e3882653a74c?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], Kelly examines the factors that contribute to scenius: \u201cthe intelligence and the intuition of a whole cultural scene. It is the communal form of the concept of the genius.\u201d\r\nIndividuals immersed in a productive scenius will blossom and produce their best work. When buoyed by scenius, you act like genius. Your like-minded peers, and the entire environment inspire you.\r\nIf you\u2019ve spent time on tech Twitter or in SF or El Segundo recently, maybe you\u2019ve felt this. It\u2019s a magical, self-reinforcing, self-sustaining loop of attention and motivation.\r\nKelly believes that four factors are at play:\u00a0\r\nMutual appreciation \u2014 Risky moves are applauded by the group, subtlety is appreciated, and friendly competition goads the shy. Scenius can be thought of as the best of peer pressure.\r\nRapid exchange of tools and techniques \u2014 As soon as something is invented, it is flaunted and then shared. Ideas flow quickly because they are flowing inside a common language and sensibility.\r\nNetwork effects of success \u2014 When a record is broken, a hit happens, or breakthrough erupts, the success is claimed by the entire scene. This empowers the scene to further success.\r\nLocal tolerance for the novelties \u2014 The local \u201coutside\u201d does not push back too hard against the transgressions of the scene. The renegades and mavericks are protected by this buffer zone.\r\nConsider these in the context of what we\u2019ve been discussing. All four sound more like Techno-Optimistic Media than mass media. Done right, Techno-Optimistic Media helps cultivate scenius at internet scale: celebration of risky moves, sharing technical ideas in-depth, feeding off of each other\u2019s success, protecting renegades and mavericks from the outside.\u00a0\r\nThat doesn\u2019t mean ideas are protected from the inside. To the contrary, by creating small spaces and scenes with people who are generally pro-technology but have very strong opinions on which technologies get built and how, we can create what Tim Urban calls an Idea Lab [ https://substack.com/redirect/2f8d7564-6849-49cc-a315-6fb3ad333203?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ].\r\nPeople in the scene can beat the shit out of each other\u2019s ideas, not each other, in the comfy confines of a friendly but opinionated community before they emerge into a broader media landscape that leans Anti-Tech Echo Chamber. As Urban writes,\u00a0\r\nIdeas in an Idea Lab are treated like hypotheses, which means people are always looking for opportunities to test what they\u2019ve been thinking about. Idea Labs are the perfect boxing ring for that testing.\r\nThe fact that Techno-Optimistic Media is small, that it doesn\u2019t appeal to a mass audience, is a feature, not a bug. Going big \u2013 and diluting the audience \u2013 would kill that vibe, and when you strike upon scenius, Kelly says: The best you can do is NOT KILL IT.\r\nYou\u2019ll have to go big eventually, if you want to be big, but there\u2019s real value in beating up your ideas in small Idea Labs and competitively friendly scenes.\u00a0\r\nOur advice is not as blunt as \u201cdon\u2019t work with the mass media.\u201d It\u2019s not that simple \u2013 because the mass media can actually be extremely good at what they do.\u00a0\r\nThe trick is trying to speak to the right audiences at the right times on the right channels.\u00a0\r\nHere\u2019s what that looks like in practice.\u00a0\r\nThe Early Days: Go Direct\r\nStartups are an exercise in getting people to believe in a crazy idea, starting with yourself and growing out in concentric circles.\u00a0\r\nBefore there\u2019s even a company, there\u2019s an idea. You can workshop it, write about it, build prototypes, do market research, and think until your brain hurts. The first person your idea needs to survive is you.\u00a0\r\nOnce you\u2019ve convinced yourself, you can start to annoy your smartest friends.\u00a0\r\nSam D\u2019Amico, founder of Impulse, said in an interview with Jason Carman [ https://substack.com/redirect/d7b0d6a5-3146-4bfb-8006-a58dfdb94ffe?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]:\u00a0\r\nI think a good checkpoint [for whether you\u2019re ready to start a company] is: \u2018Have you annoyed your friends about this idea enough?\u2019 And I definitely did\u2026 Because if it sticks in your head, and you\u2019re not being dissuaded. San Francisco is an amazing place for people who are positive about startup ideas. But if you talk to highly technical people about stuff like this, they will poke holes in everything. And if you can survive the thunderdome of that, and keep annoying your friends about it, maybe you should consider doing that idea.\r\nSurviving the thunderdome is a perfect encapsulation of our idea. Your storytelling journey should be like surviving a series of increasingly thunderous thunderdomes, starting with friends, then branching outwards. At some point, you\u2019ll want to go public, both to attract people and battletest your ideas.\u00a0\r\nNobody can change the world in a vacuum. You have to convince people to work with you; investors to give you money; customers to buy your product; and so on, at every scale.\r\nThis is, ultimately, the most fundamental job of a founder \u2014 to share a compelling story that convinces people to hitch their wagons to yours.\r\nAnd there is no possible way to outsource that task.\r\nAs former Anduril comms lead Lulu Cheng Meservey wrote in her must-read Inside Anduril\u2019s Comms Strategy: 10 Rules for Mission-Driven Founders [ https://substack.com/redirect/b46cbbd0-2dec-4dd6-b682-9b466eae067a?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], \u201cGoing direct means retaining control over your message by speaking directly to your audience instead of depending on middlemen. This is mandatory for mission-driven founders.\u201d\u00a0\r\n(Side note: seriously, you should really read Lulu\u2019s piece for hands-on practical tips [ https://substack.com/redirect/b46cbbd0-2dec-4dd6-b682-9b466eae067a?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ].)\r\nBen Nowack [ https://substack.com/redirect/64a15643-5864-41fb-a7e3-215401064591?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] did this last week. He dropped a video [ https://substack.com/redirect/80bc0c61-3718-4f8e-89bd-ae07d84028bd?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] showing off his company, Reflect Orbital, which used a hot air balloon and a mirror to reflect sunlight onto solar panels. And it got 2 million views.\r\nHaving seen a bunch of these successful unveils firsthand \u2013 and as we can verify from our conversations with Ben before, during, and after the launch (#reporting!) \u2013 Ben\u2019s DMs have been flooded with inbound messages from investors and potential employees. But he\u2019s getting valuable friendly pushback from inside the Idea Lab, too. \r\nAndrew C\u00f4t\u00e9 replied to Ben\u2019s tweet [ https://substack.com/redirect/f84ff78e-0bfd-4169-8df6-2411fac34187?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] with concerns about the model, thought about it a bunch, and then changed his mind, tweeting the next day [ https://substack.com/redirect/3924d032-afdc-4c8d-92de-55bec5c36c25?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] that \u201corbital mirrors could unlock solar as a solution for the whole planet.\u201d\u00a0\r\nAt best, Ben got a list of things to improve with his model, and at worst, he got a little preparation for questions that investors, employees, customers, and press might ask down the line.\u00a0\r\nIan Brooke\u2019s story is similar. Ian is the founder of Astro Mechanica [ https://substack.com/redirect/726b60aa-f09e-4b0a-bd9b-59626d5ed7d5?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], which has invented a new kind of jet engine that\u2019s efficient at every speed.\u00a0\r\nIan operated inside of the local SF deep tech scene for a while \u2013 it seems like every smart person we know there knows Ian \u2013 but kept a low profile online. In late February, he spoke about the company publicly for the first time on Christian\u2019s First Principles:\u00a0\r\nThat same day, Ian tweeted [ https://substack.com/redirect/de73285e-7fd1-44ff-a3a2-dacf50b3b099?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] a video of an early model of Astro Mechanica\u2019s adaptive jet engine, and blew up our little corner of X to the tune of 7.7 million views.\u00a0\r\nWith literally one video interview and one tweet, Ian grew his following from 500 people to nearly 20,000 overnight. That\u2019s an audience that he can now speak to directly as he builds the company.\u00a0\r\nBut not all founders are deeply immersed in the San Francisco tech scene. For every announcement that works as well as those of Ben and Ian, there are dozens more that fall in the forest without making a sound.\r\nLaunch Providers: the Techno-Optimistic Media\r\nThis is where Techno-Optimistic Media comes in.\u00a0\r\nYou must hone your story by yourself, going direct as a founder. But when it comes time to share your story with the world, you might find value from leveraging the folks who have already built audiences that include the people you most want to reach.\r\nPeople like Jason Carman, who works at Astranis [ https://substack.com/redirect/a9542337-40af-47f7-a9f0-c74ab70cd1fd?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] on weekdays, where he helps launch communications satellites into orbit.

I love reading his \u201cDeep Dives\u201d on companies like Replit [ https://substack.com/redirect/37bd716e-be8c-4214-9105-fb1fe6d9d318?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], Hadrian [ https://substack.com/redirect/f34a421e-0e2b-42a9-b05d-ce8b11c081cc?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], Varda [ https://substack.com/redirect/481e1ac0-ceda-48c0-aacc-7a4ed391c3e2?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], or the one he wrote about Ramp [ https://substack.com/redirect/8c8b855f-f24b-48f5-90c6-2eef455b043e?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] back in 2020 (when both Ramp and his newsletter were 10x smaller than they are today).\r\nSince then, Ben Thompson has interviewed Replit founder Amjad Masad [ https://substack.com/redirect/72da0405-207d-42b9-bd66-2ed367966a26?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]. Jason Carman did S3\u2019s on Hadrian [ https://substack.com/redirect/f0877e14-724d-47ca-be38-caf9b5489841?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] and Varda [ https://substack.com/redirect/07805575-ccb5-4882-9690-002ad0f31ae5?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]. And yesterday, John Coogan released a teaser of the documentary [ https://substack.com/redirect/9c3698fc-a15e-405f-9e51-7608c0046f5c?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] he made to celebrate Ramp\u2019s five-year anniversary. The best stories are best told by many people, through many mediums, over a long time.\r\nThe list goes on, and it\u2019s growing and reaching into new niches: Not Boring, First Principles, Pirate Wires, Newcomer, Acquired and ACQ2, Invest Like the Best, The Generalist, Sourcery, The Logan Bartlett Show. Ben Thompson is now interviewing founders on Stratechery, Garry Tan\u2019s YouTube channel and social accounts are bridging into startup announcements, and Ashlee Vance does great pro-tech work within Bloomberg at Hello World. Legacy Media can be Techno-Optimisitc Media, too. The water is warm.\u00a0\r\nEach of these is different. Pirate Wires, Newcomer, and Hello World are closer to journalism. Stratechery, Invest Like the Best, ACQ2, Garry, Logan, and First Principles host interviews. Not Boring, The Generalist, Foundations & Frontiers, and Century of Biology analyze businesses and categories. Coogan and Carman make documentaries.\u00a0\r\nThere are still more folks who are directionally Techno-Optimistic Media, even if they don\u2019t identify as such. The YouTube channel Real Engineering just released a video helping supersonic jet startup Hermeus introduce their new engines to the world:\r\nAnd Stoke Space, a new rocket-building startup, invited the legendary Tim Dodd from Everyday Astronaut to get a tour of their factory and watch their unique engine perform a hot fire test:\u00a0\r\nNo matter the platform or the audience, however, what these Techno-Optimists have in common is reach within the targeted audiences that matter to startups: investors, engineers, and potentially customers (obviously depending on your product). Many also bring credibility by being real-world builders in their own rights, and they have all spent years learning how to be compelling storytellers.\r\nThey give startups a small space to tell their full story, with all of the detail and respect required to help people see the future the way they do, and they add their own insights, experimenting with new angles to reach new audiences.\r\nThis, in Kelly\u2019s parlance, is the \u201cbuffer zone\u201d that protects the renegades and mavericks, providing narrative air cover for their ambitious and risky ideas. They can help block the little embers (some of which will grow to be fires) from the wind, and pour gasoline on when the time is right.\u00a0\r\nIf it seems self-serving for two people who identify as part of this world to write about it, well\u2026 that\u2019s kinda the point.\u00a0\r\nThe principal benefit of the Techno-Optimist Media is that they are unapologetically pro-tech. They aren\u2019t impartial, and don\u2019t have to pretend that they are.\u00a0\r\nThere\u2019s a clear risk that Techno-Optimistic Media can be too optimistic, that the hype can overtake the substance. But just as venture capitalists are driven by returns to invest in the highest-upside companies they can, we\u2019re bound by serving multiple constituencies to get that selection right over time.\u00a0\r\nIf Not Boring consistently covered companies that fizzled into meaninglessness or blew up, readers would stop reading and great founders wouldn\u2019t trust me with their stories. Techno-Optimist Media operators lose credibility if they attempt to pump bad or uninteresting companies for short-term gain. They won\u2019t get every one right \u2013 it\u2019s like venture capital \u2013 but they\u2019re incentivized to identify the most promising companies early and share the most compelling stories with their audiences.\u00a0\r\nThat audience and business model alignment is key to Techno-Optimist Media. Our audiences expect us to write about high-risk companies that might fail but also might change the world for the better if they succeed.\u00a0\r\nAnd if those companies continue to thrive, they might someday be ready for the mass media.\u00a0\r\nCrossing the Chasm: Mass Media on Your Terms\r\nCongratulations! You crushed it. You have a loyal following, a network of supportive Techno-Optimistic Media contacts, and a product you\u2019re ready to take for a spin outside of the comforts of your local confines.\u00a0\r\nGetting here sequentially means that you\u2019re coming in from a position of strength, which can be useful whether your first brush with Legacy Media goes great, or doesn\u2019t. Because it doesn\u2019t always go well, and it only rarely goes exactly as you planned.\u00a0\r\nWorking with the Legacy Media goes something like this:\r\nYour company does something cool.\r\nYou call up your favorite reporters and attempt to convince them that it is, indeed, cool.\r\nIf they agree, you send them your version of events (a \u201cpress release\u201d) and any \u201cassets\u201d (videos, photos, etc.) that can accompany it.\r\n[Massive Black Box]\r\nThe reporter publishes their story on their own channels.\r\nThere are some clear challenges with this model.\u00a0\r\nFirst, reporters can, and often do, say no. It\u2019s not their job to report everything you tell them.\u00a0\r\nSecond, although you can do your best to make your version of events compelling to a reporter, they ultimately decide how to tell your story. They might uncover parts of the story that you would like to obscure, or not \u201cframe\u201d the story as you would prefer.\u00a0\r\nThird, you can\u2019t control the timing of a press-driven announcement. The [Massive Black Box] step takes an indeterminate amount of time to clear.\u00a0\r\nFourth, the fact that news stories are published on press-owned sites (and promoted on press-owned channels) means that you only have intermediate access to the folks your news reaches. Viewers on a news site are disproportionately likely to be one-time viewers for you.\r\nIf you\u2019ve built up your direct communications and partnered with Techno-Optimistic Media, however, a lot of these challenges disappear.\u00a0\r\nIf the story is great, you can share it with thousands of people who have been there throughout the journey and will be pumped to see your name in lights. They\u2019ll feel proud and validated in their early belief, and share the story with their own audiences.\u00a0\r\nIf it goes poorly, you\u2019ve bought insurance.\u00a0\r\nOf course, at some point, if a startup becomes big and important enough, scrutiny is healthy. Whichever company makes the millions of robots that work in our factories, and eventually our homes, should be accountable to the free press. Even Techno-Optimistic Media can, should, and does hold companies accountable.\u00a0\r\nBut sometimes, you\u2019ll get hit with a hit piece that ignores the facts to sell a story. Sometimes, you\u2019ll get doxxed [ https://substack.com/redirect/01cefa20-1126-495d-9c70-26840730fab1?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] before your company is ready to go public.\u00a0\r\nIf you\u2019ve built your own channels, like Beff Jezos [ https://substack.com/redirect/0c0e1b62-a2ca-47ad-8dfd-e8526d664912?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] did with e/acc, and work with Techno-Optimistic Media, like he did with Pirate Wires [ https://substack.com/redirect/05a87cfd-a33d-4767-b51e-a5ccd6d152f4?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] and Moment of Zen [ https://substack.com/redirect/463e2be4-38a6-4cbb-b946-e5ea3e945661?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], you\u2019ll be prepared.\r\nYou\u2019ll have an army of fact-checkers armed with what they already know to be true about your company and willing to call out inaccuracies in the story. You\u2019ll have your own channels through which you can correct the record. You\u2019ll have built relationships with Techno-Optimistic Media operators with their own megaphones to correct it alongside you, and a back-catalog of material you can direct your newfound attention towards.\u00a0\r\nAttacks can even bolster how much your fans love you, particularly if such attacks are unfounded. There\u2019s no such thing as bad press if you\u2019re prepared to leverage it.\u00a0\r\nWrite Your Own Story\r\nSo that\u2019s it. Go direct, partner with Techno-Optimistic Media, and maybe, when your Idea has survived a sufficiently thunderous ThunderDome and your dream has become a little closer to reality, take your message to the mass media on your own terms.\u00a0\r\nOf course, every startup and every media outlet is different. We don\u2019t speak for everyone, this isn\u2019t one-size-fits-all advice, and we are clearly biased. But we\u2019re honest and realistic, too.\u00a0\r\nTechno-Optimistic Media isn\u2019t a replacement for legacy media, nor is it a panacea for founders.\u00a0\r\nIt\u2019s a niche alternative to the doom and gloom that dominates the headlines for people who want to learn about the promising technologies coming down the pike, and a way for the founders building those technologies to tell their story to a receptive audience in an approachable way.\u00a0\r\nOne of the fun things about this moment is the sheer ambition of so many startups. The things they\u2019re building are necessarily insanely complex, and sometimes it helps to have someone from the outside take all of that complexity seriously and explain it simply.\u00a0\r\nWe\u2019re lucky enough to be living in a time where fact is more interesting than science fiction [ https://substack.com/redirect/b3dc6bc4-8da7-4820-a09e-0ee826c6472f?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]. Pick a field \u2013 biotech, space, robotics, AI, crypto, energy, you name it \u2013 and startups in it are building things that people would not have believed possible even a decade ago. Many of these companies will fail. But some will succeed beyond our wildest imaginations.\u00a0\r\nThese are the most compelling stories being written today, and hopefully, as we pick up steam alongside the companies we cover, it will show bigger media outlets that good news sells, too. The disrupted often come around, eventually.\u00a0\r\nWe also know that storytelling is only one piece of the puzzle. Even the best storytelling can\u2019t make an uninspiring product compelling, and even the worst press in the world can\u2019t kill a product whose time has come.\u00a0\r\nOn October 9, 1903, a writer for the New York Times predicted that it would take the combined, continuous efforts of mathematicians and mechanicians \u201cfrom one million to ten million years\u201d to evolve \u201ca flying machine which will really fly.\u201d\r\nThe Wright Brothers made a flying machine fly just two months and eight days later.\u00a0\r\nThe stories we tell about technology matter. They shape how we think about the future and our place in it. Too often, those stories are dominated by a sense that technology is something to be feared rather than embraced.\r\nThe Techno-Optimistic Media offers a different narrative. One that recognizes the potential of technology and the courage of the entrepreneurs bringing it to life. One that doesn't shy away from the challenges and pitfalls, but never loses sight of the dream.\r\nAs a founder, you have the power to shape your narrative. By going direct, partnering with Techno-Optimistic Media, and eventually engaging with mass media on your own terms, you can ensure that your story is told in a way that reflects your vision and values.\r\nBut never forget that what matters most is what you build. The Wright Brothers flew in spite of the Times\u2019 predictions. The commentariat wrote NVIDIA off many times on the road to this\u2026 \r\nThere\u2019s no more compelling story than a small group of people turning an outlandish, ambitious, against-all-odds dream into a reality. It\u2019s up to you to write yours.  \r\nThanks to Christian [ https://substack.com/redirect/3fe4a342-81bc-4a1c-9bd6-46ba7e6cb371?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] for teaming up!\r\nThat\u2019s all for today!

I might even add an extra story or two. \r\nImagine going back a century, even a decade, and telling people about everything that happened this week. Robots, thermodynamic chips, solar-reflecting satellites, software that can code, and the biggest rocketship of all time going orbital.  \r\nLet\u2019s get to it.\r\nToday\u2019s Weekly Dose is brought to you by\u2026 Composer [ https://substack.com/redirect/301836a8-3588-42a9-859f-7e9fb60e212d?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]\r\nI love Composer. You know I love Composer. I\u2019m a terrible trader \u2014 MOST people are terrible traders \u2014 so I invest with Composer, where I can create rule-based Symphonies simply, set it, and forget it. You can build trading algorithms with AI, backtest them, then execute\u2014all in one platform.\r\nThey even have an active community of geniuses building community Symphonies, a few of which I\u2019ve put money in, backed up by backtests and step-by-step descriptions of how they work. It\u2019s like having a team of quants at your fingertips. \r\nRecently, Composer launched retirement accounts. I moved mine over in a couple clicks (they handle everything with your current provider) and now I can put my family\u2019s retirement savings in Bitcoin and TQQQ like the good lord intended. \r\nAs an investor and friend, I\u2019m biased, but I\u2019ve never used an investing platform I love as much as I love Composer, and I put my money where my mouth is.

For the first time in three attempts, Starship reached orbital velocity after a successful stage separation. \r\nYou read Not Boring. You know this already. I\u2019m not telling you anything new here. \r\nWhat made this one special for me was how I watched it. Puja\u2019s out of town so my mom came to help out with the kids this week. We let Dev play hooky from school for the morning to watch the launch with us. As T-0 approached, the three of us hopped on the couch together. \r\nWhen they panned to the shot of the SpaceX team cheering from the Hawthorne HQ, my mom, who reads Not Boring because she loves me but is a far cry from an Elon fanboy or space nut, started tearing up. In the final ten seconds, Dev counted down along with the commentator. As Starship took off, the three of us fell silent, and then cheered, glued to the screen. \r\nStarship is an engineering marvel. It might be the vehicle that makes humans multiplanetary. But what hit me watching this launch is the power of moonshots to make people of all ages feel like they\u2019re part of something bigger and forward-moving. \r\nTech isn\u2019t perfect, but this is why we write the Weekly Dose \u2014 so that more people can see the wonder that humans are capable of creating, and hopefully feel just a little more optimistic about where we\u2019re heading. \r\n(2) Gold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them [ https://substack.com/redirect/ef0e0e8b-dc95-4f91-9a6f-e4c936a1a93b?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]\r\nAshlee Vance for Bloomberg\r\nCognition AI is full of sport-coders.

The tweet announcing the product currently has 27 million views. \r\nI\u2019ve gotten to play around with Devin over the last couple of days, and it\u2019s a totally different experience than you might be used to with something like ChatGPT. You tell Devin something you want to code \u2014 a website, game, debugging your code, spinning up an LLM inside a Docker container, whatever \u2014 and it plans out the steps required, executes them in order, and pings you when it needs something like an API key. \r\nGiven its name, I asked it to spin me up a site that has Devin and Maya\u2019s names bouncing around the screen, which it did quickly and deployed to Netlify [ https://substack.com/redirect/9e88a745-e51a-401d-9263-e6db38051066?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ].\r\nThe early demo is impressive, especially when you consider that the company officially incorporated two months ago, and it will only get smarter and faster from here. The speed shouldn\u2019t be surprising given that the team of 10 has won 10 IOI gold medals for competitive coding, and that its CEO, Scott Wu, did this when he was a kid:\r\nIf you\u2019re a real diehard Not Boring reader, you may remember Scott\u2019s brother, and Cognition AI team member, Neal Wu from the piece I wrote on Ramp in 2022 [ https://substack.com/redirect/85e8ffee-0106-4ab3-81c0-19f63ee553de?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]: \r\nAs someone who doesn\u2019t know how to code but would love to, I for one welcome our AI coderlords. \r\n(3) Ushering in the Thermodynamic Future [ https://substack.com/redirect/a3c1dbb5-29d0-4d17-8ab4-87978f1267c7?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]\r\nGuillaume Verdon & Trevor McCourt for Extropic\r\nExtropic\u2019s superconducting chips are entirely passive, meaning we only expend energy when measuring or manipulating its state. This likely makes these neurons the most energy-efficient in the universe.\r\nNot Boring Capital portfolio company Extropic AI came out of stealth a little earlier than expected when Forbes doxxed its co-founder [ https://substack.com/redirect/78c970e2-d169-4ad8-b29e-84f08079ea2f?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], Beff Jezos/Guillaume Verdon, late last year. The company promised that it would explain more about what it was up to soon. \r\nOn Monday, it did, releasing a litepaper that provides some more detail on its plans to build thermodynamic chips. Sitting between classical computing and quantum computing, thermodynamic computing essentially uses the fluctuations of electrons as random number generators to provide the randomness needed for Energy-Based Models.\r\nEnergy-Based Models perform well when there\u2019s limited data or when modeling tail events by taking a brute force-ish approach: it imagines all possible events, including those not in the training data, assigns probabilities to each event based on their compatibility with the data, and penalize the lower-probability events. Imagining every possible event and assigning probabilities to each of them would consume a ton of energy in a classical computer, but by using nature\u2019s randomness and baking it into the physics of the chips, Extropic gets that energy practically for free and can operate orders of magnitude faster. \r\nThese models might be very useful in applying generative AI to weather forecasting or financial markets, among other high-value use cases.\r\nIf you want more explanation than my feeble human brain can provide, check out the litepaper and:\r\nAndrew C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s tweet explainer [ https://substack.com/redirect/4a2fb8c2-5051-4ce4-b9d4-11bbac6b86c2?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]\r\nGuillaume and Trevor on Christian Keil\u2019s First Principles [ https://substack.com/redirect/3177bd20-26c2-4fed-91df-b07382231e7b?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]\r\nGuillaume and Trevor in conversation with Garry Tan [ https://substack.com/redirect/53b9448d-6172-4167-ba27-11799d5baa9d?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]\r\nExtropic is taking a massive swing and attempting to accelerate the next era of computing, which Guillame and Trevor believe is inevitable as silicon transistors hit \u201cMoore\u2019s Wall.\u201d They\u2019re building analog chips and the software that runs on top of them. If they succeed, C\u00f4t\u00e9 wrote that they\u2019ll build the Transistor for the AGI Era that \u201cunblocks fundamental progress, relaxes resource constraints, and forever changes the world.\u201d That\u2019s a swing worth taking. \r\n(4) Sharing a Bit More About Reflect Orbital [ https://substack.com/redirect/ba393651-e4da-4444-a56f-162aa4a5aa94?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]\r\nBy precisely reflecting sunlight that is endlessly available in space to specific targets on the ground, we can create a world where sunlight powers solar farms for longer than just daytime, and in doing this, commoditize sunlight.\r\nBen Nowack for Reflect Orbital \r\nEven when Extropic makes computing much more energy efficient, we\u2019re still going to need to consume a ton of energy. That\u2019s how we progress. \r\nThe curves suggest that solar is going to have an enormous role to play in producing that energy \u2014 it just keeps getting cheaper as we build more of it. \r\nOne of the most interesting things happening now that people are beginning to trust solar\u2019s curve is that there are businesses being built to complement and enhance solar. Batteries are the obvious complement \u2014 they keep getting cheaper too, though not as fast as solar itself.\r\nBut there are more creative complements, too. Terraform Industries, which uses solar to produce synthetic fuels, is one that I\u2019ve written about a few times. And this week, a startup called Reflect Orbital [ https://substack.com/redirect/b751f0bf-3dab-4540-8511-87f7468a8903?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] announced what it\u2019s been building on twitter. \r\nReflect sits at the intersection of two curves: cheaper solar and cheaper launch. It plans to send satellites with mirrors on them into orbit, and use those satellites to reflect sunlight on solar farms when it\u2019s dark. Nighttime has been one of solar\u2019s biggest challenges; Reflect is kinda trying to solve night. If they do, they\u2019ll make solar panels and solar farms more productive, make them even better investments, and drive the price down even further as they drive installations up.  \r\nNow if that doesn\u2019t brighten up your day\u2026 \r\n(5) With OpenAI, Figure 01 can now have full conversations with people [ https://substack.com/redirect/30542b50-1c85-44ba-8c4f-86ab299ac07d?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]\r\nOn it, so I gave you the Apple because it\u2019s the only edible item I could provide you with from the table.\r\n\u2014 A robot, while also picking up trash\r\nJust watch the video. \r\nThat robot wasn\u2019t coded to do any of the things in the video specifically. It was trained on a lot of video data, and is now able to respond to verbal requests to do physical things in real-time thanks to that training and a partnership with OpenAI. \r\nThis comes weeks after Figure, the company behind the bot, announced a $675 million round at a $2.6 billion valuation from investors including Jeff Bezos, Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI. \r\nLike Devin, this is as dumb as these robots are ever going to be. Every time one of them learns how to do something new, all of them will know how to do it, like the Neo \u201cI know Kung Fu\u201d thing from the Matrix applied to a growing fleet of humanoid robots. \r\nEnergy, dexterity, and intelligence [ https://substack.com/redirect/da2634f1-6034-4ed0-b3e6-ae467b829ef2?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]\u2026 it\u2019s all happening. \r\n(6) Ethereum Completes EIP-4844 Upgrade [ https://substack.com/redirect/402daa0b-26ce-40d7-94a5-209a369f036c?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]\r\nOne of Ethereum\u2019s biggest challenges historically has been that it\u2019s expensive to do anything on the chain. Gas fees are regularly ~$5-10 and can spike into the hundreds of dollars. \r\nIn response to that challenge, a number of groups have built Layer 2s (L2s) that handle a bunch of transactions off of the Ethereum mainnet, and then send them down in batches. L2s have brought gas fees sub-$1. If you\u2019re making a big trade or buying a valuable NFT, something like $0.30 is nothing, but if you want to bring all sorts of actions onchain, asking users to pay $0.30 each time is still tough. Imagine having to fork over 30 cents every time you like a tweet. \r\nIn 2022, Ethereum devs drafted and implemented a proposal, EIP-4844, that introduced \u201cblob-carrying transactions\u201d to lower costs and improve scalability. Blob-carrying transactions contain a large amount of data, called \u201cblobs,\u201d that can be used to bundle multiple transactions together and process them off-chain. The blobs are stored on the Ethereum network for a short period, allowing anyone to download and verify the data if needed. This ensures data availability for L2s.\r\nThis week, Ethereum successfully completed the Mainnet upgrade to 4844. Gas fees on L2s have plummeted to less than 1 cent in most cases, a longstanding holy grail. \r\nI view blockchains as platforms [ https://substack.com/redirect/38e0cc97-c4e5-4486-bff9-f50b4f1cedbc?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], and think that the more trade-offs that get eliminated, the more developers will build onchain to take advantage of blockchains\u2019 unique properties. Cost has been a really big trade-off. I\u2019m excited to see what people cook up with sub-cent transaction costs. \r\n(7) Company aiming to \u2018de-extinct\u2019 mammoths creates elephant stem cell line [ https://substack.com/redirect/52bf5170-5258-428f-b602-b94013e7e383?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ]\r\nChristie Wilcox for Science\r\nA biotech company has succeeded in converting skin cells from Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) into stem cells [ https://substack.com/redirect/8e35e9e8-022c-41f8-b196-1f74db9f8d9d?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ] capable of growing into the layered cells that become vertebrate tissues\u2014a feat that may not only help conserve the endangered species, but also aid efforts to bring long-extinct woolly mammoths back to life.\r\n\u201cYour scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn\u2019t stop to think if they should.\u201d\r\nJust getting the obvious Jurassic Park line out of the way here before letting you know that a startup co-founded by legendary Harvard geneticist George Church successfully converted the skin cells from Asian elephants into stem cells, which can grow into other types of cells and bingo bongo, the wooly mammoths are back. \r\nColossal [ https://substack.com/redirect/b77c9593-20e7-4e12-8ea6-f532daa06195?j=eyJ1IjoiMTlueWhlIn0.uYntGdj7gFf71BKxPpfk7OerjbLdesvM86tcmQsMq2o ], the company behind the work, has a lot left before it can meet its splashy initial goal of de-extincting the wooly mammoth, but its a step towards an absolutely \u2026 colossal \u2026 step in its mission to make extinction extinct. \r\nWe\u2019ll be back in your inbox on Tuesday.

Arriving in 1348, most likely carried into the port of Melcombe Regis in the bloodstream of an infected rat or flea from mainland Europe, this ruthless plague quickly set to work on decimating the human population of the British Isles.\r\nThe bubonic plague harvested men, women, and children as easily as a sharpened scythe threshed frail stalks of wheat. Within months, entire villages became ghost towns, fields lay fallow, and an eerie quiet fell upon bustling markets and town centres that once hummed and chattered with human life.\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: All future Abundantia newsletters will be open for all, in full. By popular demand, we have made the decision not to continue to paywall some of our work for paying members only. We only ask that you support this newsletter as a paid subscriber if you want to support our work. We\u2019re sure you will all be happy with this decision.\r\nThe Black Death took the lives of somewhere between a third to one-half of England\u2019s population\u2014as many as two million people. Fewer people meant a severely diminished labour force, which resulted in the peasantry being in a unique bargaining position with the titled land-owning class who ruled the land. In a rare boon, wages for the lowest classes of society began to rise, and peasants tasted a newfound sense of worth that hadn\u2019t been enjoyed for dozens of generations beforehand.\r\nBut the ruling class couldn\u2019t let this stand for long. In a bid to push the scales of this new balance of power back in their favour, the British Government\u2014under the command of King Edward III\u2014implemented the Statute Of Labourers in 1351, making it illegal for anyone to work for wages higher than pre-plague levels. It was a blatant move designed to crush the new economic power of the peasant class, and was enforced by punishing those who disobeyed with heavy fines, public humiliation by being placed in stocks, or even flogging.\r\nBut it wasn\u2019t the wholesale death of almost everyone a person knew, or even the subjugation of new earning power by the state that would destroy the will of the British people. That would eventually happen after the implementation of new oppressive taxes.\r\nAs the century ground on, England implemented three new poll taxes on the population, primarily to fund the Crown\u2019s ongoing Hundred Years\u2019 War against France. While previous taxes were mostly based on a percentage of a person\u2019s income, poll taxes were usually a fixed amount for everyone, irrespective of someone\u2019s assets, level of income, or ability to pay. Obviously, this disproportionately hammered the financial wellbeing of the poorest members of society.\r\nThe first of these taxes arrived in 1377 during the reign of the young King Richard II, which required every person over the age of 14 to pay one groat\u2014equal to four old pence\u2014to the crown. For many peasants, even this small amount represented a significant portion of their income. The second came in 1379, which was more progressive in that it operated on a sliding scale where those with a higher income would pay more. But the straw that broke the proverbial camel\u2019s back was the final poll tax of 1380, which required every person of fifteen years or older to pay one whole shilling to help fund the war.\r\nIt was during the collection of this third poll tax that the crown started to meet resistance from the people. In May of 1831 in Essex, tax collectors found themselves rebuffed by the population, who refused to pay. When these officials of the Crown attempted to punish the villagers for their defiance, they were attacked and forced out of town. Word quickly spread through the region, sparking a broad rebellion against England\u2019s elite ruling class.\r\nVery soon, almost the entirety of southeast England was in revolt. Rebel groups from Essex and Kent massed in their thousands and began an angry march towards the nation\u2019s seat of power in London. Along the way, the groups attacked tax collectors and government representatives, looted customs houses, and burned manors to the ground, venting their anger on anything that represented a symbol of authority over the peasantry. Upon arriving in London, the Savoy Palace was razed by fire, and the Temple of the Knights Hospitaller was similarly attacked.\r\nThe people had spoken. And their voices carried the unanimous chant of \u201ctaxation is theft!\u201d\r\nAs I write this, I find myself deep within the wilderness of Lapland. A place filled with unspoiled nature, and wild climates, but most relevant to this story, lies within the borders of Finland, the nation with the second highest taxes on the planet.\r\nIn Finland, depending on where an individual lives, it\u2019s possible to pay up to 66.75% of one\u2019s personal income in taxes when federal, municipal, social security, and church taxes are taken into account. Only Belgium is higher, where an absolutely insane 79.5% is the maximum income tax ceiling.\r\nNow let\u2019s compare Finland\u2019s example to the kinds of taxes that made English peasants so furious they revolted against their masters.\r\nAlthough it\u2019s hard to figure out exactly what a peasant in the 14th century earned, several sources estimate that it was probably somewhere between two and four pence per day. If we assume a peasant only took one day of work off per week for rest as was most commonly the case on the sabbath, we can estimate 312 working days per year, which would equate to 78 shillings (936 pence) in income per person, per year.\r\nBased on that calculation, in the year that the heftiest poll tax was levied, this would amount to an additional 1.2% of the average peasant\u2019s income. Add this on top of the other taxes commonly paid at the time (a tithe of 10% to the church, and a feudal land tax that was estimated between 2%-10%), a medieval peasant in the year 1380 could have expected to pay a maximum of 21.2% of their income in tax.\r\nBut it was the extra 1.2% poll tax in 1380 that finally broke them. And to show you how insane that was compared to what we suffer in modern times, let\u2019s compare their taxes to what most of us currently pay today.\r\nTake my personal example of living in Iceland as I currently do.\r\nBecause of my personal income, I\u2019m in the highest tax bracket of Icelandic society; 46.25% of my income goes to the government each year whether I like it or not. But the truth is, this isn\u2019t where my tax story ends, as income tax is just one of the taxes that drain my wallet each year.\r\nIt doesn\u2019t include what are commonly known as hidden taxes.\r\nAfter I pay tax on my salary, I also pay 24% Vir\u00f0isaukaskattur\u00a0(known elsewhere as VAT or sales tax) on almost everything I buy in daily life. I pay fuel duties whenever I fill up my Jeep with diesel, I pay extra tax on electricity when I plug in my Polestar, and I pay road tax and registration on both those cars every year just to legally be able to drive them in public. I pay excise duties on certain items that are imported into the country, I pay Icelandic customs a handling tax just to receive the goods I ship in from abroad, I pay taxes on real estate, and I pay an 11% tax just for the privilege of being able to put food in my belly when I buy food.\r\nThe reality is that I don\u2019t pay 46.25% tax on my income in Iceland. With all these hidden taxes involved, I have calculated that I probably pay around 70% of everything I personally earn to the Icelandic tax authorities in a year just to be able to live there.\r\nSure, Iceland is a developed nation where society is believed to be fair, where people have equal opportunities, and where things just work. But it\u2019s also a country where the former finance minister Bjarni Benediktsson was just found to have acted corruptly in the recent government selloff of shares in the nation\u2019s second-largest bank \u00cdslandsbanki so that he could line the pockets of his family. And in news that will surprise absolutely nobody, he suffered basically no negative consequences for his actions. He did resign his position as finance minister, but only so he could be installed as the new minister for foreign affairs only a few days later.\r\nIn other words, the ruling class is allowed to have its way as it always has, while we peasants must pay to keep our nations running.\r\nRemember the example I gave earlier about Finland\u2019s maximum upper tax rate of 66.45%? Well, this is before hidden taxes are factored in. Taking those into consideration, some Finns are likely paying close to 80% of their income in taxes each year.\r\nDon\u2019t think you\u2019re out of the woods just because you don\u2019t live in a Nordic nation. If your home is the United States, Australia, Canada, anywhere in Europe, or in most of the developed world, you\u2019re suffering a similar fate at the hands of taxation as I am.\r\nIn Australia, it\u2019s estimated that the average person pays an additional 150+ hidden taxes in daily life: things like Goods and Service Tax (GST), car registration taxes, and more. The average German may pay closer to 200 hidden taxes each year. And Americans are hit with sales taxes of up to 7.25% depending on the state they live in, property taxes, road taxes, import duties, and a tax of 7.5% every time they fly domestically within the USA. Remember, these extra taxes hit after your income tax has already been paid to the federal government.\r\nIf you live in any of the places I\u2019ve mentioned above, you\u2019re almost certainly paying more than half your income to your government. If you live somewhere like Australia, Germany, Japan, Austria, France, or any of the Nordic nations, it\u2019s more likely over two-thirds of what you earn.\r\nThere is no simpler way to say it: we currently live in the highest-taxed time in human history.\r\nImagine being in business with a silent partner that you didn\u2019t choose to be in business with, who you are forced to continue to do business with, who takes more than half of every dollar you earn, who is allowed to mismanage your money as they see fit, and who can throw you in prison or take away your rights if you don\u2019t pay them. Well, we don\u2019t have to imagine, because that is the reality of the world we live in today. Those silent business partners are our governments.\r\nAlmost everywhere, our taxes continue to rise. But instead of life getting better because of handing over more of our money to the state, life is becoming demonstrably and statistically worse for almost everyone at the bottom levels of the Western world. The cost of living continues to rise, and we\u2019re constantly hearing how the quality of basic services like healthcare, public transport, and utilities are getting worse in most developed countries.\r\nIf you\u2019re a part of today\u2019s modern workforce, it\u2019s the first time in generations that you\u2019re statistically likely to be worse off financially and economically than your parents or grandparents were. And good luck attempting to afford a home.\r\nPeasants in 14th century England revolted against their masters based on paying barely above 20% of their total income in estimated taxes. So why do we accept paying 50%, 60%, or 70% of our income like this should be a normal part of everyday life?\r\nWhy don\u2019t we protest? Why don\u2019t we revolt? Why don\u2019t we rebel?\r\nBecause we\u2019ve been raised to believe since birth that this is normal. Because we\u2019ve been made dormant, fat, and slovenly by entertainment, culture, and an industrial food system that poisons our bodies and numbs our minds.\r\nBecause most people aren\u2019t taught that even though the average American or Australian is paying more than half their income in tax today with these hidden taxes taken into consideration, in the year 1912\u2014barely a century ago\u2014people in those nations paid zero percent tax to their governments.\r\nWe\u2019ve gone from 0% to 70% or more of our income being paid to the state in just over a hundred years in certain countries. At what point will it stop?\r\nIt won\u2019t. Not unless we do something about it.\r\nTaxation isn\u2019t just theft. The way tax is levied by our modern governments is the greatest theft in the history of mankind.\r\nIt\u2019s a system designed not to foster opportunity and success for the average person, but to build a colony of obedient slaves who will stay at their station, while our leaders and their benefactors plunder our nations for all their worth.\r\nExpect a follow-up on this story in the coming week.\r\nLeon Hill\r\nCo-founder, Abundantia.\r\n\u00bb NOTE TO SUBSCRIBERS\r\nAs mentioned above, all newsletters will continue to remain open without any paywalls for all Abundantia subscribers; both our Sunday newsletters like this one, as well as our previously-paywalled mid-week mailers.

But amidst the humble simplicity of cobbled streets, the grandeur of ornate palaces, and the artistic brilliance that permeated every level of society, it was easy to forget that the lives of citizens of Florentine citizens were controlled in almost every way by a single family: the Medici.\r\nIf anything at all, the Medici family were a dominating octopus whose tentacles penetrated almost every level of society in Florence. Through its Medici Bank, it funded and controlled economic interests at home and throughout Europe. As patrons of artists like Leonardo DaVinci, Botticelli, and Michelangelo, the family ensured influence over society in culture and the arts. And via embedding family members in positions of governance\u2014including Florence\u2019s highest office of Gonfaloniere\u2014it cemented its ability to rule the people for its benefit. They were even able to censor undesirable philosophies being taught in universities and schools, ensuring the ideals of future generations would align with de\u2019 Medici interests and values.\r\nAt the helm of this formidable empire stood Lorenzo de' Medici, who was more commonly called Lorenzo the Magnificent. Lorenzo, a supremely adept and cultured leader, commanded the resources and authority of one of the most influential dynasties of his time, seemingly poised for unrivalled dominance. Yet, his path was destined to be persistently challenged by a formidable adversary; the zealous preacher Girolamo Savonarola. A man who would become a relentless thorn in Lorenzo's side at nearly every twist and turn of his rule.\r\nBorn in the city of Ferrara to the north, Savonarola was a Dominican friar who first came to Florence in 1490. Almost immediately, his fiery sermons began to stoke the embers of rebellion within the hearts of Florentine citizens, who came to follow him for his vehement opposition to the corruption within the city. Savonarola regularly preached against the moral failings he saw within the church, and the lives of decadence and luxury practised by many within the organisation. If attacking the Catholic church wasn\u2019t enough, he also spread his ire of the Medici family, challenging the stranglehold they held over the city.\r\nSavonarola regularly took to the streets to boldly reprimand the de\u2019 Medici in public. He believed the family was the root of the moral and political corruption spreading throughout the city, publicly berating them for controlling the ideas and speech of the people, and disseminating the view that they should be ousted from power in order to install a theocratic republic to govern the city. One where a council of righteous citizens would shepherd Florence into a more prosperous future.\r\nTo the de\u2019 Medici, Savonarola was initially nothing more than a vocal nuisance. But as his following grew, the public image of the Medici family began to shift from them being perceived as cultural benefactors, to tyrants who exploited the poor and downtrodden for their own benefit.\r\nBut the people of Florence wouldn\u2019t have to wait long for their deliverance from the de\u2019 Medici oppressors.\r\nAfter King Charles VIII crossed the Alps in 1494 and began his sacking and conquest of Italy, Savonarola cemented his place as a champion of the people by meeting the French king outside the city in November of that year. This resulted in Florence being saved from a similar fate to much of Italy\u2019s north, the Medici and oligarchic allies being barred from holding office, and a new political party advised by Savonarola to now rule over Florence.\r\nThe humble preacher had beaten the Medici family, and even saved his city from an invading king. But neither of these victories could protect him from the pope.\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Our midweek newsletter is only for paying subscribers.

He was a boy who would soon change the face of a continent like nobody before him in history, even though the forces of destiny were initially levied against him.\r\nThe son of the emperor Wiraqucha, Yupanki wasn\u2019t slated to become ruler of the Inca after his father. That divine honour was to be given to his brother Urco, who was so loved by Viracocha that he was appointed as crown prince of the people.\r\nAs a young man, Yupanki won a stunning victory against the Chanka people, who had been sworn enemies of the Inca for decades. After offering the slain bodies of the Chanka to his father to walk upon as part of the rites of victory, the emperor Viracocha refused the honour his son meant for him, instead offering the spoils of war to the soon-to-be-emperor Urco. Yupanki rebelled against the emperor\u2019s wishes, stating he had not won the victory for his brother, but for his father.\r\nAs a result of his son\u2019s disobedience, Viracocha was thrown into a rage. The emperor Viracocha plotted to assassinate his son as a message to any who would oppose his word, or his law. However, news of the plot reached Yupanki and the attempt on his life failed, resulting in Viracocha fleeing out of fear of reprisal and being forced into exile. After his father\u2019s exile, the favoured heir Urco was murdered soon after\u2014reportedly at the order of his brother\u2014which resulted in Viracocha allegedly dying of extreme grief.\r\nWith his claim to rule unchallenged, the boy Yupanki was hailed in the Inca capital Cuzco as a hero of the people, and was renamed Pachaquitik: the \u201cEarth Shaker\u201d and new emperor of the empire. With that, Pachacuti would almost solely focus his attention on expanding the empire at all costs.\r\nAny tribes or groups of people who found themselves living outside the borders of the Inca kingdom soon became targets of assimilation. The first to fall were the Inca\u2019s historic enemies the Chankas, who previously seized Inca territories under Viracocha\u2019s rule. Other tribes that soon found themselves living under Pachacuti\u2019s rule included the Soras and the Ayarmaca people, as well as parts of the Chincha tribes to the east. However, after sending his brother and general Capac Yupanqui to finish the job of assimilating the Chincha, Pachacuti had him executed for failing to carry out the campaign to his standards, ending the life of another of his siblings.\r\nPachacuti\u2019s brutality and high standards weren\u2019t solely reserved for his family members, however. Under his leadership, he implemented sweeping reforms to ensure the ongoing obedience of all people who were absorbed into his people. He called this system the mitma.\r\nThe purpose of the mitma was simple: to break up previously conquered ethnic groups in order to stifle potential rebellion, and foster the forced adoption of Inca beliefs, traditions, and practices. To achieve this, Pachacuti always started at the top.\r\nKilling the leadership or king of a newly-conquered tribe often nurtured hatred and the kindling of revolt towards their new Inca masters. So instead, Pachacuti ordered the children of conquered tribal leaders to be sent to Cuzco where they would undergo years of indoctrination and education, including being taught the Inca language Quecha, and groomed to be future political leaders of the empire. This ensured that the next generation of any subjugated people\u2019s leaders would be loyal to the Inca, as well as forcing any current leaders to remain subservient by means of keeping their children hostage in the capital.\r\nOnce the head of the snake was dealt with, Pachacuti focused on the body. The mitma decreed that entire groups of people were forcibly relocated from their ancestral homes to new areas of the empire, compelling them to integrate into cities or regions with strong allegiances to the Inca empire. This diluted the old loyalties a group of people once held, at the same time promoting religious, ideological, and cultural assimilation that would ensure the strength of the Inca empire.\r\nThe mitma ensured that within a generation or two, the ancestral foundations of cultures that had lasted for centuries had crumbled into nothing more than memory and dust; what remained was only Inca. Pachacuti had succeeded in wiping the slate clean of almost all previous cultures to ensure the homogeneity of the Inca, and the total obedience of its people.\r\nIn the rare cases of dissidence, or where a person refused to abide by the ideological beliefs that were a part of the state-promoted norm, it was seen as a serious threat to the empire. These crimes of thought were severely punished, generally by throwing offenders off a cliff to meet a grisly death on the rocks far below.\r\nIn simple terms, the mandate of Pachacuti was to obey. In deed, in speech, and even in thought.\r\nIt seems that many leaders in our modern world want us to do the same.\r\nHead of the World Economic Forum and real-life Dr Evil impersonator Klaus Schwab recently spoke about the kind of world his organisation seems to be hell-bent on moving us into. And as you might expect, it\u2019s a world that will build on personal privacy, freedom of thought, and the autonomy of citizens everywhere.\r\nOh wait\u2026 nope. It will be the total opposite.\r\nTranslated from French, Schwab said in a recent interview \u201cIn this new world, we must accept transparency, and I\u2019ll even say total transparency. You have to get used to it, and you have to behave accordingly. It becomes\u2026 integrated into your personality.\u201d This on its own is terrifying in a very Orwellian kind of way. But the worst part of his speech in my opinion is that which we hear echoed over and again from those who advocate for certain forms of totalitarian control, as he finished by saying \u201c\u2026but if you have nothing to hide, you shouldn\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\r\nOne of Schwab\u2019s most loyal ideological boot-lickers is Canada\u2019s PM Justin Trudeau. Although Trudeau once held pride of place amongst the cesspool of decrepit global leaders for projecting an image of the handsome golden boy of political progress, many Canadians changed their tune when he began freezing the bank accounts of people who supported the mostly peaceful trucker protests in early 2022.\r\nMore recently, just last month Canada\u2019s Radio-telephone and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced its plans to impose regulations on independent forms of media like podcasts that are distributed within the country. Distributors of podcasts like Spotify will be required to register with the government, as well as be required to contribute to the creation, production, and distribution of Canadian and indigenous content. In other words, if you want to operate in Canada, a certain percentage of the content you produce here must be Canadian.\r\nBut what is \u201cCanadian\u201d, anyway? Isn\u2019t Canadian what the people of Canada decide it is, and what it evolves into over time based on the free exchange and distribution of ideas of the nation\u2019s citizens? Or is Canadian what the bureaucracy decrees it is, by enforcing that the people must imbibe ideas the government deems are in line with the views of the nation?\r\nDespite the fact that Canada\u2019s Charter of Rights and Freedoms specifically states that Canadians are guaranteed freedom of thought, belief, religion, and expression, it obviously doesn\u2019t extend to those expressions which Daddy Trudeau and his government don\u2019t like.\r\nBack across the pond in the UK, the nation that once maintained its place as the lords-of-almost-all on our planet also has a human rights act that deems all in the nation have a right to the \u201cfreedom of expression\u201d. However, mere weeks ago in September, the British government passed sweeping new laws that will regulate online content. The 300-page Online Safety Bill is one of the most distressing examples of a Western democracy stifling the free expression and thought of its people, by incentivising social media platforms to take down content the government disagrees with; even if that content may not be illegal.\r\nAlready, we can see evidence of the UK\u2019s tampering with public opinion in the recent matter of the censorship of Russell Brand.\r\nYou probably already know that Brand has recently been embroiled in turmoil relating to accusations of indecency and assault against multiple women. If I were a betting man, I would probably put money on Brand not being completely innocent in at least some of the things he\u2019s being accused of, especially taking into account his own admittance of previous bad conduct towards women. But in reality, my opinion shouldn\u2019t mean a damn thing: as far as I\u2019m aware, we still live in a society where someone is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.\r\nTo the British government, Brand\u2019s public peril has been the perfect opportunity to silence his constant criticism of the regime. Several members of the UK\u2019s parliament have sent letters to organisations like Rumble and TikTok requesting that Brand\u2019s content be demonetised on their platforms in an obvious effort to silence him. Something YouTube actually seemingly complied with, as they banned the British commentator from monetising his content on September 19.\r\nWhat we are seeing is a government clearly meddling to silence someone they see as a dissident. All the while, Brand has not been charged with any crime (at least yet, anyway). Regardless of your views of the man himself, I think we can all agree this is a serious and dangerous overreach by one of the most powerful governments on the planet.\r\nIn my final example taking place in my birth country of Australia, a place that spawned the happy-go-lucky charm of the Wiggles, multiple arrests have taken place over the last few years for people simply having opinions that contradicted the government\u2019s public health orders. One of the most striking examples was when a pregnant woman was arrested in her Melbourne home for simply sharing a Facebook post promoting an anti-lockdown event. To be clear, she wasn\u2019t the promoter, creator, or organiser of the event; she merely shared it on her own timeline.\r\nThe Victorian assistant police commissioner admitted to the arrest made for \u201cterrible optics\u201d, but then defended the police\u2019s heavy-handed approach, saying what they did was \u201creasonable.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s reasonable to arrest someone for simply disagreeing with their government overlords.\r\nThe above are all very varied examples of the censorship of free thought in our modern world, being perpetrated by those who are in power. But despite individual nuances, the message which ties them together is clear: your ideas, beliefs, and expressions are only valid if they mesh with the state-sponsored ideology that your government wants you to obey.\r\nI believe the golden age of freedom of thought and speech on the internet is coming to an end. Our ability to say almost anything we want, and share the kinds of content we have previously shared with abandon, is already being restricted and stifled.\r\nBut this will only happen if we allow it to.\r\nAlthough the people who spanned the Inca empire once boasted a range of varied opinions, ideas, expressions, customs, and even gods, Pachacuti ended that within just a few generations. All he left the people with were the ideas, beliefs, and expressions he mandated were acceptable.\r\nI fear if we allow the laws I\u2019ve outlined here to propagate and be further accepted into society, we\u2019ll be faced with the same thing in only a generation or two. We\u2019ll be living in a world of state-sanctioned ideas. A world that our children, or grandchildren will believe is normal, because that will be the world they were born into, and the world that has shaped their ideas and beliefs. The only world they have ever known.\r\nDo you want that world to come to pass? I don\u2019t.\r\nWill you obey? Only time will tell.\r\nWe all have a voice. I think it\u2019s time we use it.\r\nLeon Hill.\r\nCo-founder, Abundantia.\r\n\u00bb NOTE TO SUBSCRIBERS\r\nThese Sunday newsletters are always free to all subscribers.

Here's what these numbers mean. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nLABOR\r\n\r\nTrend of the Year: Tech layoffs  Trend of the year  Morning Brew\r\nEvery few months during the pandemic, a video would go viral of a Big Tech employee sharing a \u201cday in the life\u201d where they dined on catered lunch, treated themselves to espresso, declined a company-sponsored massage, and appeared to do\u2026not that much work. You don\u2019t see many of those videos anymore.\r\n\r\nInflation, the Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes in response to inflation, and the subsequent slowing of the economy all played a role in 2022 marking the apparent end of the tech industry\u2019s blistering two decade growth run. This year about 150,000 tech workers were laid off from both major companies and smaller startups\u2014including 51,000 in November alone.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s a troubling figure for what had been one of the economy\u2019s strongest growth sectors, but economists don\u2019t expect it to spell doom for other industries. Even as tech companies downsized, the broader labor market remained strong throughout the year, with the unemployment rate ticking up slightly to just 3.7% as of November.\r\n\r\nMark Zuckerberg blamed himself for the company\u2019s pandemic overstaffing when he told employees Meta would be culling 13% of its workforce, or 11,000 jobs. After the pandemic led to Amazon\u2019s most profitable period in history (during which the company doubled its workforce over two years, per the NYT) the tech giant announced it would cut around 10,000 tech and corporate jobs\u2014though internal rumors put the actual number around 20,000.\r\n\r\nOther notable tech companies that laid off a significant portion of their workforce this year: Robinhood (31%) Snap (20%), Stripe (14%), Lyft (13%), Carvana (8%), and DoorDash (6%).\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t forget crypto: About 26,000 crypto sector employees were laid off in 2022.\r\n\r\nAnother big source of tech job cuts: Elon Musk. The billionaire halved Twitter\u2019s staff when he took control of the company, laying off roughly 3,750 employees. And back in June, he announced a 10% reduction in salaried workers at Tesla.\r\n\r\nBottom line: When announcing these layoffs, several tech CEOs admitted to a similar mistake\u2014they overhired during the pandemic, believing that Covid-era trends in sectors like e-commerce, gaming, and stock trading would persist beyond the public health emergency. They didn\u2019t.\r\n\r\nRunner-up: AI apps\r\n\r\nOn the heels of human workers losing jobs: artificially intelligent workers gaining them. In 2022, AI art apps like Dall-E  and Midjourney  showed us what Dr. Phil would look like as Goku, AI Time Machine  showed us what we\u2019d look like as a 19th century arctic explorer, and the chatbot ChatGPT  showed us what it\u2019d be like to have a friend with all the answers (though not always the right ones). Investors have begun to pour money into the so-called \u201cgenerative AI\u201d sector, believing that the technology could transform how we work and live.\r\n\r\nRunner up: BeReal\r\n\r\nAnother huge 2022 trend: BeReal. The photo-sharing app exploded in popularity this year\u2014jumping from 7.7 million downloads in April to 53 million in October\u2014for its focus on authenticity (and because famous musicians kept taking them for people at concerts). How do you know an app was successful? Instagram and TikTok both copied it.\u2014MK\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\nENTERTAINMENT\r\n\r\nBiggest Own Goal: Any time Kanye West opened his mouth  Kanye West  Morning Brew\r\nLooks like Elon Musk wasn\u2019t the only one to lose billions via Twitter this year. Kanye West managed to sink his net worth from $2 billion to $400 million, according to Forbes, by sending corporate partners running with antisemitic tweets and erratic behavior that only seemed to escalate any time the rapper was given a platform to speak publicly.\r\n\r\nThe cycle of controversy began in October when West, who now goes by Ye, wore a \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d t-shirt at Paris Fashion Week. After Sean Combs, aka Diddy, criticized the shirt, West got himself kicked off Instagram with a post that suggested his fellow rapper was being controlled by Jews. That\u2019s when West\u2014who hadn\u2019t tweeted in nearly two years\u2014took to Twitter to complain, posting that he would go \u201cdeath con 3\u201d on Jewish people.\r\n\r\nTwitter locked his account, and the corporate fallout began.\r\n\r\nFashion house Balenciaga (which would later experience its own self-imposed scandal ) and talent agency CAA quickly cut ties with West, and film studio MRC shelved a completed documentary about him.\r\n\r\nAdidas drew backlash  for not severing its relationship with West immediately, but it ultimately did\u2014even though executives expect that killing the Yeezy line will take 250 million euros ($246 million) off its bottom line this year.\r\n\r\nEven companies that didn\u2019t have deals with Kanye disavowed him. After Adidas dropped him, Skechers said he showed up at its office and had to be escorted out.\r\n\r\nBut West kept making antisemitic statements every chance he got. When sympathetic friends tried to give him a chance to redeem himself, West just dug the hole deeper. Alex Jones of Infowars (himself a notable own-goaler\u2014see: the Sandy Hook defamation cases ) interviewed West and appeared to be trying to give him a chance to back off his earlier comments. Instead, West doubled down, saying he admired Hitler. And after Musk let West back on Twitter, he was promptly banned again after tweeting out an image that combined a Star of David and a swastika.\r\n\r\nWhere does this leave Ye? Music remains the one area where West still has a major presence. Spotify\u2019s CEO said it wouldn\u2019t remove  his music from the platform because the music itself, unlike the things West has said publicly, didn\u2019t violate the streamer\u2019s rules. West gets ~50 million listeners per month on the platform.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nRunner up: Ticketmaster botches Taylor Swift ticket sale\r\n\r\nThe ticketing site became Public Enemy No. 1 this fall after it managed to stir up the hornet\u2019s nest that is Taylor Swift fans. When the presale tickets  for Taylor Swift\u2019s highly anticipated Eras Tour went on sale, fans trying to purchase them with special Ticketmaster-issued codes crashed the system. The presale opportunities went so poorly that the company had to cancel the planned public sales day. The outcry from disappointed Swifties drew the attention of lawmakers, who took aim at the company\u2019s monopoly on live events. It soon emerged that even before the debacle, the Department of Justice had started investigating  its parent company Live Nation\u2019s possible abuse of power. Ticketmaster also suffered a rebuke from Swift herself, who said her team had asked \u201cmultiple times\u201d if the company could handle the demand and was assured it could.\r\n\r\nRunner up: SBF talking to the media\r\n\r\nMost people being investigated for fraud by authorities in multiple countries follow their lawyers\u2019 advice and keep their traps shut. Not former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. He kept on talking to any news outlet that asked questions right up until he was arrested , admitting that he screwed up royally but maintaining that he had not knowingly defrauded anyone. It\u2019s possible that all that chatter may have sped up the timeline of his arrest, since prosecutors didn\u2019t want his \u201cmistakes were made\u201d narrative to gain acceptance. Maybe overconfidence kept SBF yapping away. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will be arrested,\u201d the former crypto mogul said during a Twitter Spaces hours before he was taken into custody.\u2014AR\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL POLITICS\r\n\r\nMost metal moment: Snake Island defender says \u2018Russian warship, go f*** yourself\u2019  Ukrainian soldiers  Morning Brew\r\nOn the first day of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, a group of guards defending a small island in the Black Sea received an ultimatum from a Russian cruiser: Surrender or get struck by a missile. Their defiant response\u2014\u201cRussian warship, go f*** yourself\u201d\u2014instantly became an iconic symbol of Ukrainian heroism in the face of the invasion. It\u2019s also been enshrined as a wartime meme that now graces t-shirts, mugs, and even a Ukrainian postage stamp.\r\n\r\nMany see the moment as a perfect metaphor for the conflict between Russia\u2019s powerful war machine and the smaller, less well-equipped Ukrainian army.\r\n\r\nLike the defenders of Snake Island, Ukraine has put up much more of a fight against the metaphorical Russian warship than Vladimir Putin expected. After almost ten months of fighting and heavy casualties on both sides, Russia was able to seize just one regional capital in Ukraine (only to lose it last month).\r\n\r\nWhat happened to the actual warship? As for the literal warship involved in the incident: It was the guided missile cruiser named Moskva, the $750 million flagship of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, and it was sunk  less than two months after it was told to go f*** itself. The Snake Island defenders were initially thought to have been killed in action, but they later turned up in Russian captivity. The service member who uttered the legendary phrase came home in a POW swap and received a medal for his actions.\r\n\r\nRunner-up: NASA smashes spacecraft into asteroid\r\n\r\nIn a rehearsal for its hero role in a disaster scenario, NASA smashed a spacecraft into an asteroid  to change its path. Though Dimorphos, the small celestial body that was hit at 14,000 miles per hour, was never on a course toward our humble blue marble, the method NASA was testing could one day be used to avert an apocalyptic asteroid\u2013Earth collision.\r\n\r\nRunner-up: News site asks if Liz Truss will outlast lettuce, and lettuce wins\r\n\r\nAfter British Prime Minister Liz Truss\u2019s policy proposals sent international markets into a tailspin, The Daily Star tabloid launched a longevity challenge between her premiership and a head of lettuce. As the UK economy faltered, the newspaper livestreamed the produce sitting on a table next to a framed photograph of Truss. After just 44 turbulent days in power (on Day 6 of the lettuce challenge), Truss walked away  from Downing Street with the lettuce still looking crisp. To be fair to the ex-PM, the lettuce had to deal with way less media scrutiny.\u2014SK\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\nGAMES\r\n\r\nThe puzzle section \r\nBrew Mini: See how far you\u2019ve come with your Mini solving in 2022 by playing today\u2019s puzzle  and compare it to your time from earlier this year.\r\n\r\nGuess the skyline\r\n\r\nThis is the skyline of which US city?\r\n\r\nSkyline of a US cityGetty Images\r\n\r\nAROUND THE BREW\r\n\r\nTis the Season for cyber threats  Tis the Season for cyber threats \r\nReduced staff during the holiday season can leave businesses vulnerable to cyber threats.

Here's what these numbers mean. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL POLITICS\r\n\r\nMost Consequential Person of the Year: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  Morning Brew\r\nBeing the voice of Paddington Bear and serving as a wartime head of state are typically roles for different people, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has both on his resume. He\u2019s had the world\u2019s attention since 2019, when he parlayed his popularity as a comedy actor into a hugely successful presidential campaign. But after Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, Zelensky\u2019s international prominence rose to a new level.\r\n\r\nAs the face of the war effort, Zelensky is widely perceived as the embodiment of Ukraine\u2019s resoluteness in the fight for its independence and the democratic values it shares with its Western allies. Ukraine\u2019s army is smaller and less powerful than that of its enemy, so garnering the support of sympathetic countries has been instrumental to its ability to sustain a prolonged defensive campaign. Zelensky\u2019s ability to generate positive PR for his country\u2019s cause and secure much-needed aid and military equipment have been key contributors to Ukraine\u2019s military successes.\r\n\r\nThe sketch comedian-turned-supreme commander in chief seemingly possesses an endless supply of swagger and media savvy\u2014traits that have helped him rally the troops at home and win critical support abroad. From his olive green attire to his stubble, everything about Zelensky\u2019s wartime appearance conveys one message: He is fighting alongside his people.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe president is here\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the onset of the war, US officials reportedly offered to help Zelensky evacuate from the country. He didn\u2019t take them up on it, and is said to have responded with the now-iconic motto, \u201cI need ammunition, not a ride.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe secured the ammo, as well as the admiration of Ukraine supporters worldwide. Starting on the second day of the war, when Zelensky declared \u201cthe president is here\u201d in a selfie video  recorded on a street in Kyiv\u2019s government district, his regular addresses to the nation remain a powerful rallying cry. He\u2019s also used speeches to lawmakers in allied nations to set the agenda on international support for the war effort and hasn\u2019t shied away from leveraging social media to speak directly to Russian citizens.\r\n\r\nZelensky\u2019s popularity beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders is such a potent force that some world leaders have been accused of copying  Zelensky\u2019s style and exploiting visits to Kyiv as photo ops  to boost their own popularity at home.\r\n\r\nPlace in history: Zelensky\u2019s public persona as a courageous statesman leading his country through its darkest hour has drawn comparisons to Winston Churchill. But as with Churchill\u2019s tenure, Zelensky\u2019s presidency is not devoid of controversy . Both his war and peacetime governing will ultimately play a part in shaping his legacy.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nRunner up: Elon Musk\r\n\r\nMost newsrooms have long established an Elon Musk beat, but the former world\u2019s richest person really outdid himself in newsworthiness in the past twelve months. The habitually provocative entrepreneur apparently figured that stirring the pot on Twitter wasn\u2019t enough, so this year he decided to buy it.\r\n\r\nHis tumultuous acquisition of the bird app in the name of turning it into his own free-speech utopia, as well as the subsequent mass layoffs and fraught policy changes at the company, were nothing short of a variety show (except with real people). In case anyone got bored, there were also scandalous attempts  to find a diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine, which prompted a not-so-diplomatic response from the country\u2019s foreign ministry.\r\n\r\nMusk\u2019s purchase of Twitter has caused troubles at his other companies: Tesla stock has lost a significant chunk of its value since the acquisition. His controversial decisions made even some of the biggest Musk loyalists question his judgment, and led to a wider recognition that perhaps our tech billionaires don\u2019t have brilliant solutions to all of life\u2019s problems.\r\n\r\nRunner up: SCOTUS\r\n\r\nIn June, months after a draft opinion leaked, a majority of the Supreme Court\u2019s justices ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade in a decision that upended decades of reproductive health policy in the US and had a profound impact on the fall\u2019s midterm elections. More landmark decisions are coming next year and this time they\u2019ll affect generations of current and former college students: SCOTUS will rule on the legality of POTUS\u2019s student debt forgiveness plan and affirmative action in college admissions.\u2014SK\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0   \r\n\r\nTOGETHER WITH APOLLO NEURO\r\n\r\nShow your nervous system a li\u2019l TLC  Apollo Neuro \r\nThe Apollo\u2122  is the only wearable that actively improves your health, unlike other wearables that just track it.

It looked like it came straight out of GoldenEye 007 on N64, and he was promptly roasted to a crisp by the internet hordes.\r\n\r\nSome choice commentary :\r\n\r\n\u201cLove how they perfectly captured the cold, soulless, and empty Zuckerborg corporate approved feeling\u201d\u2014Twitter user lukebju19951\r\n\r\n\u201cIn fortnite you can be Goku with a shotgun\u201d\u2014Twitter user lordbeef\r\n\r\nAfter Zuckerberg endured plenty of cyberbullying, he posted a new, higher-res virtual self-portrait that featured much more detailed background imagery on Instagram. He admitted via caption, \u201cI know the photo I posted earlier this week was pretty basic\u2026the graphics in Horizon are capable of much more.\u201d\r\n\r\nHowever, the new images\u2014like Horizon World\u2019s similarly unimpressive legless avatars\u2014still looked more like an old Pixar movie than the latest Halo. And that caused the internet to question\u2026what exactly is Meta spending billions of dollars on?\r\n\r\nBottom line: Meta has gone all-in on its metaverse and its augmented- and virtual reality technologies, but the effort is bleeding money. And, at least so far, it\u2019s not earning the company many likes from the public.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nRunner up: BalenciagaGate\r\n\r\nBalenciaga\u2019s holiday campaign featured child models holding teddy bear-shaped bags decked out in BDSM-style gear. The luxury brand quickly apologized, but internet sleuths discovered legal documents concerning child pornography in photos for another campaign that further stoked the fire\u2014and prompted a second apology the same day. Even longtime Balenciaga supporter Kim Kardashian publicly denounced  the brand.\r\n\r\nRunner up: An Applebee\u2019s commercial during a CNN news segment on the Ukraine war\r\n\r\nApplebee\u2019s was metaphorically pelted with awesome blossoms after an advertisement for \u201c$1 boneless wings\u201d aired split screen-style next to the news outlet\u2019s live coverage  of Russia invading Kyiv. Applebee\u2019s served dad energy in its apology, saying it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in CNN for running the ad. After the incident, the fast-casual restaurant suspended all its advertising on the network.\u2014JW\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\nVIDS\r\n\r\nMorning Brew's top videos \r\nWhile we consider ourselves the funniest, most brilliant, and most gorgeous team at the company, the Brew\u2019s video team is clearly coming for the throne with the truly hilarious content they produced over the past year.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the most popular Brew videos from 2022.\r\n\r\nThe best of TikTok:\r\n\r\nWorth it?
