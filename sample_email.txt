Phinn’s decision comes after prosecutors asked for the conviction to be tossed in light of new evidence about two alternative suspects for the murder. Prosecutors, who had previously fought back against Syed’s efforts to get a new trial, noted they were not saying he was innocent but that Syed, who has been serving a life sentence for the past 23 years, deserved a new trial and should be allowed out of prison while the investigation continues.\r\n\r\nSo, what’s the new evidence?\r\n\r\nTwo suspects, who have not been named, were considered in the original investigation but not properly ruled out. Both had a history of violence against women, and one even threatened to kill Lee. Syed’s lawyers also want new forensic testing to see if DNA evidence is available.\r\n\r\nSyed, who was arrested at 17 and is now 41, has always maintained that he was not involved in the 1999 crime, and his story came to national prominence when Serial debuted in 2014.\r\n\r\nThe podcast’s first season, which raised doubts about the evidence against Syed, including flimsy cellphone records, has been downloaded more than 300 million times and is considered the world’s most listened-to podcast.\r\n\r\nSerial didn’t just change Syed’s life, it also changed podcasting\r\n\r\nThe This American Life spinoff was the first podcast ever to win a Peabody Award, and besides garnering prestige, it showed just how popular the medium could be. It also breathed new life into the true crime genre and inspired a slew of imitators—and some of those have also led both to exonerations and new convictions.\r\n\r\nWhat’s next? Syed isn’t totally out of the woods yet—the judge gave prosecutors 30 days to decide whether to drop the charges or retry the case.

A massive leak over the weekend containing 90 videos of footage from Grand Theft Auto VI was confirmed  to be legitimate by its publisher, Rockstar Games, on Monday. “We are extremely disappointed to have any details of our next game shared with you all in this way,” the company, one of the world’s largest video game publishers, wrote on Twitter. The game, reportedly at least two years away from being finished, appears to feature a woman protagonist for the first time (confirming reports from earlier this year). The hacker behind the leak also claims to be behind the hack of Uber last week, and has threatened to leak more data soon.\r\n\r\nBook bans are on the rise, and the censors are organized. More than 1,600 books were banned  from US schools during the last school year, affecting 4 million students, with many of the targeted texts featuring LGBTQ+ and racial themes, according to PEN America. The bans weren’t just the work of concerned individual parents; the free speech group says 50 organized advocacy groups have sprung up (most of them since 2021) to challenge books—and they were involved in close to half of the removals. Texas had the most book bans, with a total of 801.\r\n\r\nHurricane Fiona leaves a trail of destruction. After dumping at least 27 inches of rain and knocking out power on Puerto Rico, Hurricane Fiona lashed  the Dominican Republic yesterday before heading out into the Atlantic (it’s not expected to hit the US East Coast). The governor of Puerto Rico called the damage “catastrophic” and warned that it would take days for electricity to be fully restored. Heavy storms are also hitting Japan: 9 million people were told to evacuate their homes before the arrival of “super typhoon” Nanmadol—one of the biggest typhoons Japan has ever experienced.\r\n\r\nHOUSING\r\n\r\nOpendoor is flipping out after big losses  Upside-down house Francis Scialabba\r\nOpendoor, the home-flipping site, is probably regretting its bulk order of subway tiles and DIY laminate floors. The company lost money  on 42% of resales in August, according to Bloomberg.\r\n\r\nThe company that rode the first wave of real estate iBuying , a way to automate real estate purchases, was hailed as the “Amazon of homes” when it went public in 2020. Its strategy: make fast offers for homes using an algorithm, do some light reno, and resell them, sometimes in less than a few months.\r\n\r\nBut red-hot house prices during the height of Covid were looking more like smoldering coals by June, and the Fed pumping interest rates through the summer had potential buyers closing Zillow tabs. So the company had all this inventory that it paid a lot of money for that no one wanted to buy.\r\n\r\nYou might remember when Zillow shut down its home-flipping business last fall for similar reasons. And proving that you shouldn’t throw stones if you have overpriced houses, Opendoor even trolled Zillow after the announcement, saying Opendoor was “open for business.”\r\n\r\nBig picture: Some analysts say the worst is over for Opendoor, but other indicators—like homebuilder sentiment dropping for its ninth straight month in September—hint that the housing market party has finally hit the morning after.—MM\r\n\r\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \r\n\r\nCRYPTO\r\n\r\nNobody knows where Do Kwon is  John Cena GIF WWE via Giphy\r\nSouth Korean prosecutors have requested that Interpol issue a red notice  against Terra and Luna founder Do Kwon, alleging the disgraced crypto mogul isn’t cooperating with investigators. (An Interpol red notice is essentially an appeal to law enforcement officials worldwide to arrest a given individual.) Accused of fraud and under investigation by the SEC, Kwon was believed to be in Singapore, though police there say he is not in the city-state.\r\n\r\nThe founder defended himself against charges that he’s on the run from investigators, writing on Twitter last weekend that “I am not ‘on the run’ or anything similar.” In response, prosecutors issued a statement that Kwon was “obviously on the run.” Kwon’s whereabouts remain unknown.\r\n\r\nThis is just the latest chapter in the ongoing saga of a massive crypto collapse that spooked the entire industry. Even if you’ve gone to great lengths to avoid reading anything that includes the word “stablecoin,” you might want to pay attention to this story—the May collapse  of Kwon’s crypto company wiped out $40 billion of investors’ cash and sparked a broader crypto market crash, resulting in losses of about $500 billion.\r\n\r\nThat collapse sparked investigations into Kwon and Terraform Labs (his company), ultimately leading South Korea to issue an arrest warrant last week for him and five others connected to the company.—MK\r\n\r\n\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \r\n\r\nGRAB BAG\r\n\r\nKey performance indicators  A crowd walking in front of an office building Bim/Getty Images\r\nStat: Fall is just about here, and workers across the US are putting on pants and heading back to the office . In 10 major metro areas, average office use between Sept. 8 and Sept. 14 was back up to 47.5% of what it was in early 2020, according to Kastle Systems, a company that tracks keycard swipes. That’s the highest it’s been since Covid shutdowns got rolling. Still, most folks seem to prefer working in their jammies close to the weekend—midweek days had the most office entries, per Kastle.\r\n\r\nQuote: “We’ve shown that we know how to win on the battlefield. Another important task for us is to achieve victories in the economy as well, and to be an attractive country for investors.”\r\n\r\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky videoconferenced  with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss steering investments to Ukraine, which needs serious cash to rebuild ($350 billion by one estimate), even as it continues to fight back against Russia’s invasion. The two discussed how the asset management giant could give the nation pro bono advice on setting up a reconstruction fund.\r\n\r\nView: Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral in pictures.
